He demonstrated an ability to listen to the patient and search the EHR for relevant data. Patients felt that he was attentive to them and was thorough in the information he gathered.
Physical Exam:  Vincent performed very thorough physical exams.  He routinely asked to confirm exams with his preceptors when he found abnormalities.
Fund of Knowledge:  Vincent had a strong fund of knowledge, at the level of most 4th year students. He was a very motivated learner who would research what he didn't know and then come back to the preceptor after reading to educate the preceptor as well.
Clinical Reasoning:  Vincent was able to handle patients with multiple serious medical and psycho-social conditions efficiently and generate a thorough differential. His plans were appropriate.
Clinical Presentation:  Vincent's presentations were efficient and concise.  It was easy to understand his thought process.
Patient Management:  Vincent was able to manage very complex patients, and also followed up on their issues after the visit.
Patient Communication and Counseling:  Vincent developed very good rapport with patients and I could often could hear them laughing with him. Like most of us, he still needs to work on using non-clinical language with patients.
Professionalism:  Teamwork and Communication:  Vincent was very diligent, and extremely professional. He had good rapport with office staff as well as physicians.
Lifelong Learning Skills:  Vincent was always motivated to do and read more, and circled back to attendings to fill them in on what he'd learned.
Summary:  Vincent was a pleasure to work with. He is a mature, motivated, diligent and well organized student with strong communication skills.  He was able to manage very complex patients.

Clerkship Didactic Review:
Review of Med U Formulations Statements: Vincent's formulation statements were missing pertinent information from the history and/or physical.  
Social Determinants of Health Interview:  Vincent interviewed a disabled wheelchair bound patient who lived in an extremely poor rural community without transportation or running water and was very isolated. Vincent interviewed this patient during a home visit, and was struck by this patient's very challenging living conditions, and how significantly they contributed to his inability to care for his many chronic conditions. Vincent's essay demonstrated a real understanding of the importance of social determinants on the health of the patients he cared for, as well as the value of home visits in truly understanding the lives of patients and the challenge of delivering medical care in underserved communities..

Clerkship didactic review

Social Determinants of Health
Dudley submitted an excellent social determinants of health write-up. He interviewed a recent immigrant and thoughtfully contrasted his quality of life and experience with health care in 3 countries.

Med U case summary statements
Dudley made steady progress on his med U summary statements. It was clear that he was paying attention and after a few practices, Dudley was able to identify nearly all of the  key concepts in cases.  Dudley's summary statements did get more concise as the block went on. He can continue to work on this by trimming down contents and using semantic qualifiers.   The goal of the summary statement is to consolidate key words and concepts into a very compact and predictably structure. This cognitive exercise will allow you, as well as others listening on rounds, to be triggered by these key words and more easily generate as well as narrow down potential differentials and next steps in patient care. ","Dursley, Dudley",Dudley,Dursley,2,8/4/17,2017,5,0,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

Comments should refer to specific behaviors, reinforce/clarify your above ratings, and particularly address areas of strength and weakness.<br><br>",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"History Taking:  Cho collected appropriate information and was able to provide excellent histories on her patients.  
Physical Exam:  Cho's physical exam skills were excellent.  She was thorough and detailed, noting abnormalities most others would have missed. 
Fund of Knowledge:  Cho demonstrated an exceptional fund of knowledge and applied it very well.
Clinical Reasoning:  Cho was able to develop a broad differential diagnosis. 
Clinical Presentation:  Cho's notes were excellent and thorough.  In the ED setting, her write-ups were a little long for an ER note but they were well-written and right on track.  She presented patients in a clear manner.  She should continue to practice her oral presentations of patients in a step-by-step organized way similar to her notes.
Patient Management:  Cho did a very good job summarizing and developing a plan for treatment.  She shared thoughtful insights that were helpful in the management of patients.
Patient Communication and Counseling:  Cho develops good rapport with patients.  She has a transparency in speaking with patients and discussing work-up and treatment that patients respond to enthusiastically.  She works hard to achieve mutual understanding with patients regarding their medical plan.
Professionalism:  Teamwork and Communication:  Cho is very energetic and willing to help do anything (even more menial tasks) to help with clinic flow. She had great communication skills, both with patients and with staff.  She demonstrated a willingness to see all patients and stay late if needed to finish up with a patient.  Overall, she was a pleasure to work with and got along very well with the entire staff. 
Lifelong Learning Skills:  A particular strength of Cho's is her curiosity. She wondered about how the disease presented itself, which got her wondering what having the disease meant to the patient, how the patient could cope with it on a day-to-day basis and then how she could help the patient to own the disease and personally manage it.  She was always very motivated to see patients and expand her knowledge base.
Summary:  Cho has kindled her first clinical exposure at this somewhat alien and confounding setting with grace and vivid enthusiasm.  She was well-liked by our patients and helped provide excellent care for them. Her heart and her head are in a good place. She is non-judgmental she can get along with people in a genuine sense, and that will carry her far in her career.  Our staff really appreciated her energy. It's easy to let time pass without really engaging yourself and Cho kept up a good spirit and work ethic the whole time.  In her research project, she took an active interest in pursuing projects helping WRSU understand the role of lead poisoning in our pediatric population. Great initiative!  

Clerkship Director Assignment Review
Med U Summary Cases:  Cho was concise and able to identify most of the key concepts in the cases. Two recommendations to improve further: 
1.	Be sure to always communicate all three elements of Epidemiology/risk factors, chronicity of symptoms, and key history and physical findings. 
2.	Stay with a consistent format that places history ahead of exam findings. This will allow others to more easily follow you.   
The goal of the summary statement is to consolidate key words and concepts into a very compact and predictable structure. This cognitive exercise will allow you, as well as others listening on rounds, to be prompted by these key words and quickly generate and narrow down potential differentials and plans.
Social Determinants of Health Interview: Cho demonstrated an excellent understanding of social determinants of health in her interview with an Apache patient with end stage liver disease.  She discussed the environmental, social and financial factors affecting his health, and thoughtfully reflected on the ""historical trauma"" which impact the health of many on the reservation and in other marginalized communities.  Her review of the NYC data added to her understanding of how health care disparities impact the health of a variety of other populations.

Clerkship Director Assignment Review
Med U Summary Cases: Hermione's Med U summary statements were very concisely written. Her organization developed quickly and she was able to identify most of the key concepts in these cases.   To further improve, Hermione should continue to take stock of all key clinical elements, and to be sure to include psychosocial contributors in the cases.   The goal of the summary statement is to consolidate key words and concepts into a very compact and predictable structure. This cognitive exercise will allow you, as well as others listening to you on rounds, to be prompted by these key words to quickly generate and narrow down potential differentials and plans on rounds.   
Social Determinants of Health Interview: Hermione demonstrated a very good understanding of social determinants of health, specifically how an unstable family situation may have interfered with a child's language development and reflected on the social barriers in evaluating the child.  Hermione noted that adverse childhood events and other social determinants of health are similar in such diverse environments as the Z P and Washington Heights.

Clerkship Didactic Review

Case Summary Statements
Pansy did a really nice job on her Med U statements. It was clear that she paid close attention to the cases and was able to identify most of the key facts in the cases. She made some progress in editing down the included content so the summary statements can be more concise and easier to comprehend for others on rounds and in clinical notes. 


Social Determinants of Health
Pansy demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of SDH, as she reflected on the illness experience of a 58 year old man with chronic pain. Through his story telling, she highlighted numerous barriers to his care, and recommended ways for an ideal health care system to attend to the needs of vulnerable patients. ","Parkinson, Pansy",Pansy,Parkinson,,6/30/17,2017,4,0.6,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

Comments should refer to specific behaviors, reinforce/clarify your above ratings, and particularly address areas of strength and weakness.<br><br>",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"History Taking:  From the start of his primary care rotation, Viktor took the initiative to see patients independently.   He was efficient in his history taking. Attending physicians felt they could rely on Viktor's history for medical decision-making.
Physical Exam:  Viktor's physical exams were efficient and appropriate. He could perform a practiced cardiovascular exam and did so on the majority of patients. He was able to recognize the need for more specific exams, including musculoskeletal and neurological exams. He was able to perform exams independently. 
Fund of Knowledge:  Viktor has the medical knowledge necessary to evaluate complicated patients in the outpatient setting. He is able to synthesize guidelines with his knowledge of pathophysiology to make reasoned clinical decisions when guidelines are not available, as he demonstrated in his presentation on non-cigarette tobacco use.
Clinical Reasoning:  Viktor was noted to generate broad differential diagnoses, which were well supported and thought-out for all of his diagnoses. He was able to see complex patients with multiple, disparate complaints, and synthesize their symptoms and exam findings into a workable differential.
Clinical Presentation:  From the get-go, Viktor's patient presentations were organized, efficient, and accurate. His presentations included all relevant information without burdening the listener with an excess of data. When interrupted for clarification during presentations, he invariably both had the answer and was able to return to the presentation at the point without losing his flow.
Patient Management:  Viktor incorporated patients' perspectives and psychosocial background into plans. He has learned to incorporate preventive care into his plans consistently.
Patient Communication and Counseling:  Viktor has great communication skills and really made his patients feel at home. He is good at active listening and helping his patients feel, and be, heard. Multiple patients mentioned that they would like to continue care with Viktor as their primary doctor. His motivational interviewing, as observed, was empathetic and nonjudgmental.
Professionalism -- Teamwork and Communication:  Viktor was hard working, proactive, and professional in his time at Farrell clinic. He solved problems independently. He was reliably on time and well prepared for clinical sessions.
Lifelong Learning Skills:  Viktor was eager to learn; he took part in clinical discussions, pre-read on his patients, and accepted feedback well.
Summary:  Viktor was a pleasure to have at Farrell for his primary care rotation. He showed himself to be hardworking and advanced in his medical care, and above all to be a good listener to patients as well as to teachers.

Clerkship Director Review of Assignments:
Med U Formulation Statements:  It was evident that Viktor paid close attention to the cases and was able to identify and communicate the key facts.  His statements were very thorough and comprehensive, but all very long--the goal is to include only pertinent positives and omit negatives and ROS.  The utility of summary statements increases when the key words and concepts are organized into a very compact format, which efficiently and effectively communicates information in fast-paced settings. 
Social Determinants of Health Interview: Viktor demonstrated an excellent understanding of social determinants of health in his interview with a Spanish speaking patient who was unable to access care due to language and financial barriers. Viktor thoughtfully reflected about possible system improvements such as a discharge process that ensures outpatient followup.  His review of the NYC data added to his understanding of other factors that impact the health of minority underserved communities.

Clinical Presentation:  Dean consistently gave crisp, clear, concise and clinically relevant presentations.  His notes were very good and completed efficiently.
Patient Management:  Dean has good clinical skills and is able to manage most medical problems independently. The majority of the time,  I agreed with Dean's assessments and plans. 
Patient Communication and Counseling:  Dean reads patient's emotions and comfort level well.  He is able to work with all personality types and patients of different socio-economic status. He interacts well with children and their parents and places them at ease.

Summary:  Dean met all of my expectations for an exceptional medical student. Midway through the rotation, I gave suggestions for improvement and he followed through and met all goals. His enthusiasm to learn and see more patients was noteworthy. He would take every opportunity to learn more, and stay late to finish documentation and reading. His histories and exam were in depth. He was able to see patients and complete notes efficiently, which were crisp, concise, and insightful. At the end of the rotation, I would rarely have to make any changes to his documentation. Time management skills were excellent. Dean consistently displayed a positive attitude and fit in very nicely in our office. His rapport with patients and staff was beyond what I would expect. He has no weaknesses and performs at an exceptional level in many clinical areas. His enthusiasm and strong performance made this a very pleasant month for myself.

Clerkship Director Review of Assignments
Med U Formulation Statements: Dean did a great job on the Med U formulations.  He was concise and well organized in the structure of his summary statements, and it was clear he paid close attention to the cases and was able to identify the important facts.  He can further edit the formulations to be more concise and therefore more effectively communicate key information in fast-paced setting such as rounds.  
Social Determinants of Health Interview:  Dean wrote an extremely thoughtful reflection on a patient with PTSD and PMR which demonstrated an excellent understanding of social determinants of health and their impact on chronic disease management.  His review of the NYC data added to his understanding of other factors that impact the health of underserved communities.

Clerkship didactic assignment review

Med U case summary statement 
Neville submitted concisely written med u summary statements. This efficiency in communication is appreciate,  but some of the statements should have incorporated more key concepts  to help paint a more nuanced clinical picture (chronology sx, key physical findings, psychosocial elements). Going forward, make sure to always identify 3 things in your case summaries, epi/risk factor, timing, major H&P findings.    The goal of the summary statement is to consolidate key words and concepts into a VERY compact and predictable structure. This cognitive exercise will allow you, as well as others listening to you on rounds, to be triggered by these key words and quickly generate as well as narrow down potential differentials and plans.   

Social Determinants of Health Interview
Neville demonstrated a very good understanding of social determinants of health in his interview with an immigrant family who spoke a Pakastani dialect not accessible via the phone interpreter. Neville noted the strong social supports in this family, as well as the cultural and linguistic barriers that complicated their medical care.  He thoughtfully reflected how important the social determinant of poor health literacy is in many immigrant populations, which negatively impacts their health outcomes.  He did not discuss how his understanding of these barriers compared to the data collected by the DOH.","Longbottom, Neville",Neville,Longbottom,3,12/21/17,2017,8,0.4,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

Ginny's med U summary statements were well written. It is clear she was paying attention to the modules as these statements captured all of the key concepts in the cases.

Social Determinants of Health
On his MCY F writeup- Lee reflected on a patient with presumed chronically uncontrolled conditions who ultimately experienced complications resulting in cognitive and functional impairment. Despite not harboring the traditional social barriers to care, this patient faced a discoordinated care network, seeing numerous clinicians overwhelmed and daunted by the task at hand with limited time to collaborate, recognize, and address this individual's needs.  With so much that has happened to this patient, it would have been interesting to explore the SDH barriers that may have existed 10 or 20 yrs ago (access, financial, education, behaviorial) to result in such poor downstream outcome.  Sadly it sounds like this patient is no longer able to participate in this discussion.

Med U Case Summary Statement
Lee is quite concise in his summary statement writing.  He made progress during the block in finding and communicating all the key discoveries in an organized fashion.  To get even better, work on organizing the format, and identifying all the key triggers (including psychosocial context that may impact care) in the cases.   The goal of these summary statements is to bring together key concepts and findings into a very compact and predictably structure. The cognitive processing ritual will allow yourself as well as others (on rounds/reading your notes) to be quickly triggered by these key words to generate and narrow down diagnoses and care plan.","Jordan, Lee",Lee,Jordan,1,9/22/17,2017,6,0.6,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Clerkship Didactic Feedback

Patil was conscientious and on top of all of her clerkship didactic and administrative requirements.

MCYF- Patil wrote about the experience of one of her longitudinal patients, whose lack of social support resulted in worsening PTSD and alcoholism. She was able to see how a social intervention helped improved his physical health. 

Med U summary statements- Patil did a nice job with her summary statements. She was able to pick up many of the abnormalities in the cases and start to organize them into the summary. To get to the next level, keep looking for all the clues in the cases, including any psychosocial context as well as the physical exam findings.","Parvati, Patil",Patil,Parvati,,3/31/17,2017,2,0.6,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

His history and physical, professionalism, and management skills were at an aspirational level.  He developed a thorough understanding of multiple core primary care disease and treatments including Type II diabetes, essential hypertension, depression, anxiety, asthma, and COPD. For the first time in 10 years as a student preceptor, I received a letter from a complex geriatric patient inquiring and requesting that a medical student (Harry) whom they interacted with consider practicing in the area upon his graduation. That speaks more than highly of his professionalism and abilities to interact with complex patients. Harry will be an asset to any residency program, as he demonstrates the balance of medical knowledge and professionalism needed in the field of medicine.


FM cases summary statement review
Harry did a good job and made progress in recognizing and accurately communicating most of the key findings in cases.    To get even better, work on consistency in organizational layout (history ahead always of exam findings), and aim to communicate three things: epi (risk factors, exposures, psychosocial context), timing, H&P findings.    The goal of the summary statement is to consolidate key words and concepts into a compact and predictably structure. This cognitive exercise will allow you, as well as others listening to you on rounds, to be triggered by these key words and quickly generate as well as narrow down potential differentials and plans.","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,1/26/18,2018,1,,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

I am sure that she changed the patient's outlook on life that day.  She left smiling and very grateful for the time that Fleur spent with her.  Fleur also had a big impact on the aforementioned patient with complicated mental health needs, who was quite worked up and difficult to direct the day that Fleur spoke with her.

Case summary statement review (FM cases)
Fleur did a very good job on the case summary statements. She was generally organized, and made progress identifying most of the key elements in the cases, and communicating in a concise fashion. The goal of these summary statements is to package together key concepts in a very compact and predictably structure. The cognitive processing involved will allow yourself as well as others (on rounds/reading your notes) to be triggered to generate and narrow down differential diagnoses.

Although fairly thorough in most aspects, I think what will help Colin develop further, as he progresses in his career, is to become quicker in his history taking and physical examination. It is a challenge that everyone encounters, when taking that next step in their career, however developing it early, while in school will make the transition smoother from a student to an intern. A practical step that could be implemented would be to try to commit to memory as much of the history and physical, rather than writing everything down.

Overall Colin was a pleasure to work with. He frequently checked in to ask questions and to assist with addition work as needed. When provided with tasks, these are usually completed, although occasionally may need a reminder. Would recommend that on the sub-internship service, discharge summaries should be started and updated for patients that he is carrying. 

During rounds, would stick with being consistent with stuctured presentations including brief patient ID (i.e. age, primary complaint) => overnight events => any updated labs/studies that were pending => exam/vitals that are changed => assessment based on problems. Recommend being consistent with presenting patients with problem based assessment and plan as when they do get more complicated, it is difficult to keep tract of these issues unless the presentation is organized this way.","Creevey, Colin",Colin,Creevey,1,8/31/18,2018,,,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

Cho was an avid reader, and always sought to fill in gaps in her knowledge base.  By the end of the clerkship, Cho's write ups were very inclusive and she was able to generate an appropriately hierarchical assessment and plan. She is an excellent teacher of her peers, and organized two well reasoned presentations to the group (on approaches to jaundice and lymphoma) that were interactive, and balanced didactic teaching with good use of patient cases. Cho was very comfortable in the clinical arena, and immediately put her patient at ease in her observed history and physical. She performed a very complete history on a patient who was a tangential historian. Cho accepts and incorporates feedback quickly. She is compassionate with patients, and a great team member.

Fund of knowledge: Lee had an impressive fund of knowledge for an early third year medical student. This was evident in both his focused relevant patient presentations. He quickly caught on to the relevant data for heart failure and cardiac patients in general. He also did excellent didactic presentations to the team regarding pulmonary hypertension and the WHO classification and also on hypernatremia and its management.
Patient care skills: would perform detailed physical exams on his patients every morning and had the knowledge base to update his patients and review plans of care with them.
Presentations: were very clear and concise and demonstrated strong fund of medical knowledge.
Communication skills: communicated well with patients. Got comfortable calling consults and gave detailed didactic presentations with ease. Advanced for an early third year Med student.
Professionalism very professional. No issues
Team work: fantastic team member
Teaching: fantastic job teaching. This is really an area where Lee shined. His didactic talk on pulmonary hypertension was very helpful to the team and helped advance team understating of etiologies, work up and management of pulmonary hypertension overall and as it related to his patient. 

Lee was a wonderful student to work with and for his very first rotation of MCY year, he did a fantastic job. He was compassionate and kind to all of his patients, a team player, and fun to work with. He thought carefully about each of his patients, rose to the challenge of admitting difficult patients and was inquisitive in his H&P and assessments. His professionalism is excellent and he has a solid foundation for his fund of knowledge.  

I only worked with Lee for a few days - he had a great fund of knowledge and was always eager to learn more. He has a phenomenal bedside manner and made meaningful relationships with his patients. He also advocated for his patients frequently. His follow-up presentations were succinct and largely from memory. He was a great team player and always remained professional 

I would like to comment on my experience working with Lee Jordan on Gen Med 2 a few weeks ago. Lee was an inquisitive, highly-motivated, and thoughtful member of our wards team. He carried multiple patients at a time and presented them both as admissions and follow-ups on rounds. His notes were well-crafted and his differentials though-out and deliberate. On multiple occasions he sought to teach the team about topics pertinent to his own patients. I am sure he will develop into a well-rounded and knowledgeable house-staff officer. 

Lee was a valuable team member. His presentations were thorough and he demonstrated a good understanding of pathophysiology. He gave a good talk on hyponatremia to the team during the rotation.  

Great medical student with excellent fund of knowledge! Excellent presentations. A pleasure to work with. 



ATTENDINGS

I am continually impressed and amazed by the very high quality of the Medical Students on my rotations and this time was no exception.  Lee Jordan was extremely intelligent with a very strong fund of knowledge and the motivation to improve.  He gave excellent presentations on a number of different topics and asked very astute questions which indicated to me his interest and involvement at a very high level.  Lee did a terrific job of taking a history, doing a physical exam and synthesizing a meaningful presentation in a way that was extremely mature for this stage of his training.  He interacted very well with patients, nurses and physicians.  He was a valued member of the team and his participation and contributions was welcomed and valued.  I have only the highest praise for him and for his remarkable performances.  If there are any questions about this please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Lee was an outstanding medical student. He has an excellent bedside manner. His presentations were always on point with well thought out assessments and plan. He was self motivated and often read and brought primary literature to the group. He also was an incredible asset to the team by always being available. I would have never guess our rotation was Lee's first ward month. He is well beyond his point in training.  

Lee Jordan: he knows far more than I would expect for someone at his stage of training.  His presentations were outstanding, and his final presentation of the rotation was particularly impressive.  The case was straightforward, but his approach to the differential diagnosis""Ósorting through each alternative diagnosis and the data that did or did not fit with that diagnosis""Ówas something that I would expect from a mid-level or senior resident rather than a medical student just beginning his clinical training.  He seems to have a naturally curious, questioning mind.  Overall, a pleasure to work with.  

Lee Jordon:
Fund of knowledge : very good knowledge; showed willingness to learn 
Patient care skills: very thorough; addressed every concern that patient raised and advocated for patients
Presentations: excellent presentations  
Communication skills: good communications skills
Professionalism good raport with patients
Team work: pleasant to work with, well integrated with the team
Teaching: excellent presentations ","Jordan, Lee",Lee,Jordan,1,2/17/17,2017,1,0.6,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Please comment on this student's performance in each competency.

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Very professional student, team player, contributes good ideas to the team and truly cares for patients. 
Excellent communication skills. Professional behavior. Punctual. Courteous towards patients, patient's family members, as well as other team members and staff. Interested in learning and committed to improving medical knowledge. 
His history taking skills were above average and often uncovered details that others did not discover that were critical to a new diagnosis or influenced patient care. His presentation of new patients and on rounds were clear and succinct in a way medical students often struggle with. He was an eager learner and asked questions during rounds and contributed to the learning of others. He immediately incorporated suggestions for improvement into his practice such as note writing and physical exam skills. His interpersonal skills are exemplary and I allowed him to share test results with patients independently. 
Colin is always very prepared to see his patients. Colin knows the important questions to ask based on the patient's problem. Colin does thorough work. His presentations to the team were informative and accurate. Colin's patients like him. 
Colin has excellent communication skills and data collection ability. He can critically assess data and can come up with diagnostic and therapeutic plan.
Enthusiastic and outstanding in case presentation. 
Colin effectively gathered and interpretted patient information in the direct patient interview format. He was professional and developed good repo with the patients. The presentations were efficient and accurate. The patients appeared to enjoy his interaction. In discussion of the cases, Colin was open and honest with his understanding of the data's relationship to pathophysiology. Most importantly, he understand the relationship of disease to the person as a whole. 
I have worked with Mr. Creevey intermittently over the last year. He was on my Teaching Team in the spring 2017 and was thoughtful, intelligent and inquisitive. During that time, we spent some time reviewing how to perform a thorough H & P and on presentation skills. By his next rotation in July 2017, I was pleasantly surprised at the degree of improvement he had made. Mr. Creevey took the recommendations I made and ran with it. His History taking was thorough, and demonstrated his intellectual and personal curiosity about each patient. It was clear; he did not simply go through the motions and ask the questions he knew he was supposed to ask. The information he garnered showed a depth and thoughtfulness some physicians never demonstrate. He clearly surpasses his level of education in his ability to see the patient in the context of not only their illness but their life as well. He has a particular interest in Psychiatry and was able to anticipate how their psychosocial situation had and may influence their medical conditions. Mr. Creevey is a proactive learner. He routinely chose patients to follow and always took the lead on presenting the patient on rounds without being prompted. Mr. Creevey's level of enthusiasm, thoroughness and synthesis of a patient's medical information surpassed some of the interns on our team. 
Very bright, jumped right into role of presenting ICU patients on rounds. Was prepared to share data and problems and impressively ideas. 
Very impressed with Colins week on Critical care. Very good medical knowledge base reads and reviews appropriate literature. Very impressed with case presentations, very succinct, summarizes information well. 
Advocates for his patients -Develops broad differentials and ranks likely-diagnoses appropriate to each patient case. During 2 different patient care scenarios, he was able to think of diagnoses house staff had not initially considered and helped rule these diagnoses in or out. -Has an enthusiasm for learning and an upbeat attitude. 
This is the 3rd time I have worked directly with Mr. Creevey on the Wards. He has continued to be an excellent medical student. His clinical knowledge is ahead of where I would expect him to be. His write-ups are timely, demonstrate a thorough evaluation process and he lists appropriate differential diagnosis and commits to the most relevant. He is incredibly personable, kind and always actively participated in teaching rounds. He was trusted with a newly diagnosed HIV patient and many of the communications regarding her test results. He did this with compassion and sensitivity as she also had a dual Psychiatric Disorder. Most of all he is a hard worker. He always picks up additional patients without being asked. He finishes his work even when he has other commitments that take him away from the floors. I never have to remind him to follow up on test results. This comes from an innate sense of intellectual curiosity, which Mr. Creevey certainly exhibits.
Colin takes a thorough history and has a methodical physical exam skill, especially his neurological examination. Has a decent fund of knowledge for his level of training. He is a responsible medical student, who does not need prompting and follows-up on his patients in a timely fashion. ","Creevey, Colin",Colin,Creevey,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Fleur stood out during this rotation - she was very engaged and proactive, and started the week with clear learning objectives. It was clear from her questions and responses that she has a strong fund of knowledge to draw from and to build on, and she was a great team contributor. Her compassion for patients was apparent with a challenging case we had with a patient who had unexpected complications during a surgery, resulting in prolonged intubation. Her demeanor with the family was very kind and professional, and she contributed to the team's knowledge of the patient with an excellent patient presentation during rounds. She also researched and presented the risks and benefits of the targeted cooling therapy in anoxic brain injury, which was helpful for the team in managing the patient as well. 
Immense wisdom beyond her years Compassionate Patient thinks outside the box. 
Very good knowledge, enthusiastic, hardworking. 
Gave a very good presentation on antibiotics which was a big topic but she was able to summarize well. Her presentation skill was excellent. She was very interested to know about treatment plans and asked pertinent questions. 
Fleur worked hard in pulmonary clinic. She demonstrated a good fund of knowledge and ability to increase her knowledge. She was confident and willing to gain by discussion for advanced pulmonary issues beyond the scope of a Medical Student. Her willingness to push her learning to a higher level is a very important; one might say a superior trait of an accomplished Physician. Fleur was willing to rethink previously dismissed ideas, from a fresh perspective. Another sign of a good learner. 
It is always a pleasure mentoring Fleur. Broad and deep fund of medical knowledge. Presentations are polished and neat. Always comes up with very broad differential. Write-ups are insightful, easy to understand and succinct. Very empathetic to patients and their families, which is clearly seen in her presentations as well. Works very well as part of a team. Hardworking, always willing to stay with team and help them. I have personally appreciated her dedication many times for staying late and trying to help patients and their families understand about the complex situations. Oral presentations are extraordinary, she is a great teacher. Overall Fleur has shown exceptional dedication in her work, compassion towards patients, enthusiasm for learning and exceptionally thoughtful in understanding the needs of her fellow teammates. ","Delacour, Fleur",Fleur,Delacour,,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Brown, David"

Cedric was perhaps the most compassionate, thoughtful, and thorough medical student with whom I have worked. He is incredibly motivated to take the best care of patients he can, and went above and beyond on many occasions. The rapport that Cedric was able to build with his patients is beyond what many residents and even attendings are capable of. The way he connects with people is a skill that for some takes many years to develop. For Cedric, such an ability is inherent. One three unique instances, members of the care coordination team approached me to ask for Cedric's full name so he could potentially be formally recognized for his excellence in patient care. In addition to Cedric's interpersonal skills, his fund of knowledge is above that of many at his level. He remains curious and engaged, often looking up literature to support group discussions and contribute to the team's learning. I only have the highest of compliments for Cedric. He is intelligent, kind, and humble. I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to work with him again, and am certain he will succeed in whatever he chooses.
Cedric is an excellent student who is very enthusiastic and hard-working. He was really outstanding among his peers in maturity and compassion for his patients. We had a very challenging list and Cedric was at the forefront of taking care of our most difficult patients. He went above and beyond to spend time with one particular patient who was dealing with addiction and non-complaint with medical care. Because of Cedric' efforts and therapeutic relationship with this patient, we were able to advance his care and keep him the hospital. Cedric also participated in a family meeting involving the Ethics committee regarding this patient and made valuable contributions with a level of understanding and maturity that I have not seen in other medical students. Another example - Cedric was very compassionate towards a homeless patient with schizophrenia; he treated this marginalized, disenfranchised man with respect and dignity. Discharge planning for this patient was very complicated and Cedric was a tremendous help to me in this process - again, a responsibility that I have not seen any other medical student take on, and embrace, in the way Cedric did.  Cedric possesses a wonderful sense of curiosity and a genuine thirst for knowledge. He was always well-prepared for rounds and carried 2-3 patients, which is more than expected. He had reviewed all the data and already synthesized it prior to presenting on rounds. He had the ability to see what I would call the big picture for each of his patients, without getting bogged down by irrelevant data. He has an excellent understanding of pathophysiology and is able to formulate management plans for his patients. He asked questions on rounds, was not afraid to speak up. And he was very patient with an attending who often asked him to repeat information several times. He was responsive to feedback and incorporated any suggestions we gave him.

Definitely the best medical student I have worked with so far! He will be an amazing clinician and I hope I have the chance to work with him again!
 

Patient care skills: this is one of Cedric' strongest areas.  He demonstrated consistent and exceptional empathy when interacting with patients, and would draw the team's attention to the psychosocial wellbeing of our patients, even those whom he was not specifically following.  He had good rapport with all of his patients, and was immediately comfortable in all of his interactions, even when being scrutinized by the team.
Presentations: Cedric' presentations were thorough, well-articulated, and thoughtful.  He developed full differentials, and was able to reason his way through even difficult cases clearly.  
Communication skills: Cedric is exceptionally well-spoken, and has the poise and assurance of a much more mature trainee.  He was never afraid to offer opinions on patients during rounds, but also managed to deliver his comments in a way that was respectful and appropriate.
Professionalism : Cedric was always professional and respectful in his interactions with patients and team members.  He is a true gentleman.  He will make an excellent house officer in his chosen field.
Team work: Cedric was always more than happy to contribute to the team, and actively offered to perform tasks even for patients he was not actively following.  
Teaching: Cedric did an excellent job sharing pearls and articles he had found while reading about his patients.  He is a strong teacher, and clearly enjoys taking on the role of teacher. 

Cedric was in my sister team ""Ó I did not work closely one-on-one with him. 
Fund of knowledge: Cedric had a broad base of clinical and basic science knowledge and seemed to read on topics relevant to his patients.
Patient care skills: Strong patient advocate, consistently challenged primary team to consider how best to connect with an individual patient.
Presentations: Cedric gave a clear, well-organized admission presentation on morning rounds, with mastery of all relevant history, physical exam findings, and interpretation of imaging. He required little if any cueing.
Communication skills: Cannot assess. 
Professionalism Appeared professional in our interactions. 
Team work: Cannot assess. 
Teaching: Gave succinct explanations of medical concepts and several trials on rounds. 

ATTENDINGS

Mr. Diggory was a pleasure to work with during the rotation. He showed superb initiative in learning, both by asking thoughtful questions and doing outside readings on relevant topics. He demonstrated a good fund of knowledge during his patient presentations. Mr. Diggory was professional and he worked well with the team. He displayed excellent insight in the care of management of complex patients, taking into account the interaction between a variety of medical and non-medical components of patient care.  


Cedric was quiet on rounds. When he did contribute he showed a solid understanding of the relevant pathophysiology commensurate with his level of education. 
Based on his initial and follow-up patient presentations Cedric was a bit diffuse and scattered. He did not show that he understood the important pieces of the history, physical exam, and laboratory data to convey to us- especially for his follow-ups. I had mentioned to him that all we need is a thumb nail sketch to remind us about the patient and then in sentence or two new info since previous day but that didn't seem to happen.  Several of his patients had complicated and severe diseases in the setting of drug abuse and addiction.  He could be overly focused on the drugs and lose track of the underlying disease progression- which I would assume is what is the important learning experience for this rotation.  I thought maybe he wants to go into psychiatry but he said no.
See above.  Felt like Cedric was taking us on an interesting journey to an unknown location.
Cedric is quiet and low key but is kind, understanding, and genuine.  
Cedric showed a high level of professionalism.
The residents tell me that Cedric was a good team player.
Cedric did an excellent job with brief presentations on assigned topics including getting a few references for myself and the group on one of our patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Cedric was the student on my team. In the month that he was with us he made only one or possibly two presentations so there was not much for me to go with to assess his performance. He did not present from memory.  He did, however, follow several patients and he was able to present their progress reports adequately. His interaction with patients was quite good and he was sensitive while asking appropriate and insightful questions. He often offered comments that were appropriate and helpful. His knowledge base was as expected. He was professional in his demeanor. All told I would say his performance was a solid average for a P&S student. 

Cedric did a good job with his presentations and was professional.  He asked good/relevant questions about patient care. ","Diggory, Cedric",Diggory,Cedric,2,12/21/17,2017,8,0.2,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

He very patiently and carefully obtained detailed hx from patient with complex medical hx current and past.  Skillfully performed exam despite limitations imposed by pts. Patient.  Generally excellent performance.  
I did observe Harry performing parts of the exam including pulmonary exam, cardiac exam and neuro exam on some patients. He is able to independently perform these exams at this point. He performed an abbreviated neuro exam focusing on key elements superbly on one of our patients that needed a f/u exam. I also observed him obtaining parts of the history or clarifying the hx when presenting at the bedside. He asked opened questions and was able to narrow the questioning appropriately in an engaging, empathetic manner that encouraged sharing of information. I felt very comfortable having him lead the interview. ","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,1,History and Physical,"Barron, Beth"

Please comment on areas where this student's performance could be improved. These comments will be shared with the student but not included in the MSPE (Dean's) letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"He was able to obtain data effectively but as is the case for many 3rd year students, still struggled at times to fully interpret data and form an accurate assessment and plan. He was at or slightly above the level, I would expect for a 3rd year medical student. 
Harry's H&Ps and notes were well organized and continue to improve. I did give feedback to include more pertinent positive and negatives in the HPI and to expand his PE findings in his H&P's. He collects all the pertinent hx but doesn't always document it. This improved over the week. I also recommended that he not template his exam findings in his daily SOAP notes since it leads to excessive exam findings not relevant to f/u. 
He needs to start making plan for patients, and ""manage"" them, rather than only ""observing"" them. However, I have observed him only in cancer center, and thus he is not expected to manage cancer patients. In general, he should continue do do so in primary care medicine/surgical clinics. 
Continue to work on structured differential diagnosis to assist in developing effective assessment and plan. ","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

He gave an excellent presentation on Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia and discussed the advantages/disadvantages of different types of maintenance fluids. His ability to interpret the medical literature is clearly above average. He is doing very well at reading EKGs and interpreting acid base balance and has demonstrated his ability to take what he learned during our last rotation and apply to patients this time. He learned about a few new topics this time including UGI bleed, tachycardias, and complications of ETOH abuse. His oral presentations continue to improve. His HPI's are more organized and inclusive and presented with less use of his notes this time. His communications skills with patients, families and staff is superb. He is able to obtain key historical information in a natural flowing, empathetic manner. Clearly above average. He integrated and worked within the team very well sharing information in a positive fashion. Harry seems to be developing right on track and look forward to spending more time with him on inpatient service. 
Enthusiastic and bright, eagerly took on patients and quickly adopted systems based presentation method. Developed problem-identifying skills and showed ability to develop care plan. 
Harry is a team player who continually expresses interest in his patients' well-being. He was a delight to have on the ICU team. Patients and staff very much liked having Harry around. 
By the end of the rotation, he had a very good epistemological approach to nephrological disorders. 
Harry is an exceptional person. Great to talk to. He integrated fabulously into the team. Great interpersonal skills. Good knowledge for his level and is always curious to learn more. Looks for data to inform decisions. His presentation on Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia was well researched, prepared and delivered. 
Harry's case presentations were excellent flowing in an organized manner from HPI, PMH, Meds to PE and labs. His presentations were hypothesis driven with more focused data being provided than during his first week. He has grown tremendously in being proactive at providing the patient's relevant problem list as well as a preliminary differential diagnosis and management plan. Furthermore, with minimal prompting and time to think he was able to come up with less common potential causes of a patient's medical problem and more in depth management options. This was evident when we had a patient with hyperkalemia where he shared very accurately the management options. Harry presented on several topics including dorsal midbrain syndrome, thyroid function in pregnancy and how to predict severity of pancreatitis. He gave superb, short presentations that demonstrated his ability to efficiently summarize the key relevant clinical information for the team. He is incredibly logical in his thought process and I am certain will develop into a superb diagnostician. Harry continues to be a superb communicator with patients, including an incredibly warm, empathetic demeanor. Harry's bedside verbal presentations have developed tremendously into organized, easy flowing presentations. 
Harry is very pleasant medical student, very astute and aware of his surroundings. His medical knowledge is average. He has fantastic bedside manners, and communicates well with staff/patients. 
Harry was a pleasure to work with. He was was an eager learner, asking many questions and looking up topics on his own at times as well. ","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Lavender was a wonderful medical student, demonstrating enthusiasm, intellectual rigor and an impressive work ethic. Her fund of knowledge was notable; she was well prepared and knowledgeable regarding the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of her cases. Throughout the clerkship, Lavender demonstrated an impressive ability to critically review the literature and effectively apply it to her patient care. Her critical thinking improved steadily and significantly over the course of our 6 weeks together and was quite sophisticated at the conclusion of the clerkship. 
Lavender was very thoughtful and articulate; she always contributed to the group discussions and was very enthusiastic about sharing the knowledge that she gained with our group. Throughout the clerkship, Lavender was an effective teacher for the other students. Her formal topic presentation on opportunistic infections in HIV was very thorough and extremely well-researched. 
Lavender's write-ups were exemplary, with the Formulation and Discussion sections being particularly noteworthy for the way in which she seamlessly wove patient-specific points with information from standard medical texts and the medical literature that were pertinent to diagnosis and management. The discussions were excellent and a pleasure to read; thorough with thoughtful, broad differentials, pulling together complex histories into cohesive patient-centered stories, incorporating pathophysiology and current research.
Lavender consistently paid careful attention to the psychosocial aspects of her cases. She always included a thoughtful assessment of the patient's home support and the barriers to optimal medical care and made suggestions for how these could be addressed. More than once, I personally observed how her bedside manner demonstrated maturity and compassion. 
In terms of professionalism and attitude, Lavender was also exemplary. She was always polite, mature and respectful. Her write-ups were always punctual. Importantly, Lavender responded well to constructive criticism and made a concerted effort to improve in suggested areas.  It is clear that she wants to develop and excel. I was impressed in general with her interpersonal and leadership skills. ","Brown, Lavender",Lavender,Brown,,8/11/17,2017,5,0.2,G,General,"Brown, David"

Patil is a fantastic med student!  She is clearly eager to learn, constantly offers to help the team in whatever way possible, takes initiative, and isn't afraid to state her opinion with what she thinks is going on with a patient (with evidence) and what should be done about it.  Presentations are clear and thorough.  She is passionate about her patients and will no doubt do great in her medical career. 

Fund of knowledge: excellent for the stage that she is in med school, and she was enthusiastic about reading up on topics and learning more.
Presentations: concise, clear, confident in presenting, able to synthesize assessment and come up with a plan on her own seemingly
Communication skills: was a pleasure to work with and integrated into the team seamlessly; was not directly part of my resident/intern team so cannot comment more on communication skills.
Professionalism: enthusiastic and positive, a pleasure to be around.
Team work: wanted to integrate into the team as much as possible and did so well.
Teaching: did a presentation on CIWA protocol vs. symptom triggered alcohol withdrawal treatment in light of a few patients we had. 

Patil is a fantastic medical student -- super helpful and a great privilege to have on the team. Always willing and eager to help, genuinely cared about her patients, often going above and beyond (e.g. making sure to see a patient with active medical issue even though he was off the floor, taking the initiative to schedule outpatient follow-up, serving as a participant in family meetings, etc.). Presents well, organized, great fund of knowledge (definitely above average for her level of training), and always paid close attention to physical exam findings. Always willing to learn more about cardiology, asked very thoughtful questions. She's going to go on to be a great resident in whatever field she chooses! 

Patil is one of the best medical students I've worked with. She was extremely helpful, always making sure she did everything to help the team. She knew her patients very very well, and really immersed herself in the care of the patients. She was a valuable member of the team, and very reliable and trustworthy to carry out the team's tasks. She was very intelligent, and came every day very well read and asked multiple inquisitive questions.  Her presentations were excellent. I really enjoyed working with Patil! 

Fund of knowledge: excellent. She asked excellent questions and demonstrated solid understanding of pathophysiology 
Patient care skills: Interacted well with patients and was very thorough in exams
Presentations: Excellent presentations, able to synthesize information very well 
Communication skills: Outstanding- worked well with all on the team
Professionalism Excellent- tried to find ways to help when we were busy
Teaching: Excellent effort in bringing in articles to teach about on rounds. To get to the next level- try to describe how the articles you're reading are relevant to the patient. 

I worked together with Patil for several weeks on the cardiology service. I was very impressed with her knowledge, her curiosity to learn, and her warmhearted display of kindness to many of our sickest and dying patients. She would often stay late speaking with family members, comforting patients in the evenings, and reassuring them when they became frustrated with the unfortunate consequences of their illness. She was also excellent at having GOC discussions and helped not only translate, but lead the discussions in very difficult cases of patients dying and terminally ill from heart failure. I was particularly impressed with her ability to relay very difficult topics of conversations to the family as a 3rd year medical student- this is something myself, and other residents often have difficulty with well into their residency training. 
Of particular note, there was a very special patient who I had been regularly seeing in clinic, but was admitted to Gen Med 2 with cirrhosis while Patil was on service. She continued to follow the patient while she was on cardiology, coming with me to clinic to see her, and joining me in multiple GOC conversations with the family when she was readmitted to the Gen Med 2 service later on that month. 
All the patients she had been following loved her and really appreciated her thoughtfulness and the attention she provided them. They all trusted her and made the entire team's care for these patients much easier!
She also gave 2 very impressive discussions on non-compaction cardiomyopathy and the utility of amiodarone in patients with NSVT, as well as an introduction on pulmonary angioplasty in patients with CTEPH. These were all fascinating discussions intertwined into admission presentations of patients that she was following.

Patil worked on the sister team, and my interactions with her were brief. What I can speak to is her ability to incorporate evidence-based medicine into her presentations. For each of her HPIs, Patil references multiple studies that supported her assessment and plan for her patients. 


ATTENDINGS

She gave excellent, to-the-point presentations, and participated actively in the discussions. Patil asked questions and demonstrated an excellent fund of knowledge. No problems whatsoever. 

Patil:  highly involved and interested in clinical endeavors.  Very intelligent""Óappropriate fund of knowledge""Ócurious and asks good questions.  Presentations a little bit tentative but still quite good, but most importantly her case formulations were excellent.  Highly professional and outstanding interaction with patients.


very good fund of knowledge
attentive and participatory during rounds
Very close follow-up on her assigned patients
Read up on all the relevant medical issues
Did medical review on the relevant topics and questions we had on her patients
worked well with in intern and resident team
overall, just excellent 

Patil did an excellent job. She was an active member of the team and very engaged in rounds. She delivered a presentation on CIWA protocol to help us better understand how we could apply it. She was able to pick up cases and present them in a comprehensive and logical way later on the same day, which I found very impressive. Overall her patient presentations were very well structured and well delivered. Her patients felt well connected to her and that she was the face of our team. She was a hard worker and contributed a great deal to our team. She was a pleasure to work with on rounds. 

Feedback was given to improve communications with others as during her presentations she often lacked clarity and confidence despite her knowing the intricacies of her patient. She had a good attitude and was a hard worker. 
Her quiet demeanor unfortunately made it easy for her to be lost in the crowd.

Fund of Knowledge: Appropriate to his level of training.
Patient Care Skills: Excellent - I think its fair to assume that most if not all medical students care about their patients, but with Vincent there was never any doubt. he would always spend extra time explaining medications or procedures to the patients and I noticed his ability to deploy therapeutic touch with great effect.
Presentations: Excellent, Vincent had a knack for delivering the most relevant information, the signal, and filtering out a lot of the noise which is beyond his level of training. 
Communication Skills: One memory sticks out to me - Vincent and I were down in the emergency department with a patient with Afib w/ RVR who was agitated trying to leave AMA. While I was trying to get the patient to stay, Vincent very subtly collected a concise history and physical on the patient. I thought that situation awareness and calm under pressure stood out to be as excellent.
Professionalism: Never an issue.
Teamwork: Vincent was always willing to give me or our attending a hand with his excellent control of Spanish which I certainly appreciated.
Teaching: Vincent was always eager to share any knowledge that he had 

I worked with Vincent Crabbe. Vincent was an excellent student to have on the service. His presentations were always thorough and accurate. He had a good relationship with his patients and their families. Most of his patients thought of him as their primary medical provider during their hospitalization. He was always enthusiastic about helping out. He asks good questions and has an excellent fund of knowledge. 

Fund of knowledge Vincent carried appropriate knowledge for his level of training, and was very curious and motivated to improve this fund. Very self-directed, reading independently and asking insightful questions. 
Patient care skills: Vincent did well with his thorough histories and physicals. He approached the expert level of collecting and reporting his findings on exam and laboratory values. More than that, he was eager to provide patient care at the bedside with impressive enthusiasm and rigor. 
Presentations: Through the rotation, he progressed nicely from leaning on his notes early to presenting a clinical course and story from memory. Very well done.  
Communication skills: Vincent was very focused on communication, always asking for clarification when confused, speaking to team members with respect, and employing empathy and sympathy consistently. 
Professionalism Always demonstrated professionalism, worked hard to improve himself by asking for and implementing feedback. He did not struggle to move his clinical skills forward by working and reading on his own. 
Teaching: Often shared his readings and findings from patient-level research with the whole team. 

I did not work directly with Vincent and so cannot give very specific feedback on him. I can say, however, that he always gave very clear, concise patient presentations and spoke confidently and knowledgeably about the care plan. Friendly and professional. 

Vincent was a huge asset to our team. He proactively contacted patients' outpatient doctors and pharmacy for collateral. He was always eager to learn and asked questions on his patients as well as on other teams' patients. He developed great repertoire with the patients and their families. Even after I left the service, I could trust Vincent to help with a discharge of one of my patients. 

Vincent deserves a great deal of praise for the maturity and initiative that he brings to the hospital each and every day. When interviewing his patients, Vincent is thorough - asking all the pertinent questions related to the patient's presentation as well as obtaining the background information about the patient's social and family history. More impressively, he manages to gather the necessary information in a time-efficient manner while also developing patient rapport. His questions about the patient's medical condition are often interspersed with comments about Vincent and the patient's shared interests or experiences, and this skill helps the patients to open up to him and trust him. When on rounds, Vincent shows an interest in learning about the medical decisions for all of the patients on the lists. His questions demonstrate that he has a grasp of basic cardiology knowledge and is thinking one step further, synthesizing what he already knows and asking questions beyond the scope of a medical student. In paying close attention to all of the patients on rounds, Vincent - without being prompted - will make his own to-do list that he accomplishes during the day. I have often been astounded when Vincent approaches the team and provides a detailed list of the appointments he has scheduled, the medical records he has obtained from outside hospitals, and the PCPs and pharmacies that he has contacted. He does all of this without being asked and for patients that he is not even responsible for! Because of Vincent, the intern had less tasks, the outlook of the team was more optimistic, and our days were pleasant. He will be an excellent physician in whatever field he chooses to pursue. 

ATTENDINGS

Vincent was good. I think I heard him present one case. He was always there and followed his patients closely. Fund of knowledge was appropriate for his level. His chart notes were good. 

I never heard Vincent present an initial case and only heard 1 or 2 followup presentations, so my observation was too limited to really comment. He did seem very professional and the very brief interactions revealed a student with strong medical knowledge. He seemed quite interested in the cases. 

Fund of knowledge Vincent's fund of knowledge was at a level expected of his level of training. During team teaching rounds, he would always ask questions about things he didn't know as well as attempt to understand them. In addition, after his time on service was up and he left for another service, when given opportunity to learn and see an autopsy of a patient he was taking care he did not hesitate to go to the autopsy and partake of the learning experience.
Patient care skills: Vincent's patient care skills were outstanding. He would take ownership of the patient's and be involved with the discussion making. He would be willing to make recommendation on how we should proceed with the patient's care. You could tell from his interactions with the patients that they trust him.
Presentations: Vincents presentations were as expected from someone with his level of training. He has very detailed H and P's. He would attempt present from memory and minimally refer to the admission note.  
Communication skills: Vincent communication skills were outstanding between himself and the team as well as the patients.
Professionalism Vincent was never late to rounds and was always willing to stay late if it was necessary. He treated every patient with respect and kindness and they all trusted him.
Team work: Vincent was an invaluable member of the team. He would be willing to get blood to the lab in cases of emergencies and to help with patient admissions and gathering a complete history. Furthermore, his proficiency in Spanish was an assets when communicating with some patients.
Teaching: In my feedback session with Vincent I told him that going forward he should perform more presentations to the team about topics that interest him regarding his patients. This will maximize his learning. 

Feedback was given. He was an advocate for his patients and team remarked how he was eager to help the team irregardless of whether it was for his own patients. He wanted to help his team get things done. He was inquisitive and went above and beyond for his patients. He gave a presentation on renal artery stenosis. 
Area of improvement was to incorporate more evidence based medicine into his presentations.

I worked with Lavender Brown on GM1. I thought she had an exceptionally professional demeanor beyond that of many medical students at her level of training; she was self-motivated, interested, engaged, sought feedback and was very invested in the care of her patients. She formed wonderful therapeutic alliances with her patients & their families and was enthusiastic about any tasks related to patient care which consistently helped out the team. Her presentations were well organized, detailed and appropriate for her level of training and I would encourage her to continue seeking out feedback as she has been doing to allow them to continue to improve. She was extremely pleasant to work with, an important member of our team and will be a wonderful asset to whichever speciality she chooses to go into. 

Overall, Lavender was an awesome medical student! Her greatest attribute was her poise during presentations. She was able to take complex patient's and present them in an organized and succinct manner. When it came to the assessment, she was able to prioritize patient's by their most active and important problems, and present a logical and practical plan. She was an asset to the team off of rounds as well. She was quite reliable in retrieving distant past medical history that was pertinent to patients presenting illness. Moreover, she maintained a great attitude throughout the rotation. Lavender was a pleasure to work with. 

Lavender Brown- was part of my ID team for a few days. She was very personable, kind, thoughtful. She had a strong command of clinical medicine; her knowledge base was above average for her training level. She gave an excellent presentation of a fairly complex patient. She knew the patient very well and knew relevant medicine to discuss a broad differential and plan of action for the patient. She was professional and worked very well within our team. Solid work.  

Lavender is a bright, hard-working medical student. She was always looking up information and studies on her own, was thoughtful in her approach to working up new patients, and clearly knew every important part of their history and clinical information. She was a great team-player. 


ATTENDINGS

Lavender was with us for about 10 days.  She did a fine job on GM-1.  She seemed knowledgable and well organized, presented well (trying not to read verbatim from her notes), and when questioned at the bedside about her cases and others was able to respond with knowledge and good sense.  She seemed to be enjoying herself, and I think will blossom during the rest of her stay on Medicine. 

Lavender was on our service for two weeks. She made two presentations, both of which were well prepared, organized, and clear.  The presentations were not from memory. She contributed on rounds, knew her patients well, provided succinct updates, and demonstrated maturity, professionalism, and motivation in her interactions with patients and other members of the care team. Her fund of knowledge was appropriate for an MCY student. When asked to look into specific topics, she responded the next day with a clear and well organized update. She was enthusiastic, positive, and engaged. It was a pleasure to have her on the service. 

I only worked with Lavender for about a week or so. During this time she presented twice. Her presentations were good but she seemed somewhat hesitant in her presentation, but she was aware of the issues the patients had. I also saw that she was active on the service and during the general ""roll call"" of all the patients she seemed to know what was going on and for her patients she was pretty much on top of things. I could not tell the level of her fund of knowledge due to the limited time we spent together. 

Lavender presented mainly from memory with only some assistance from her notes. Overall was confident during her HPI, but needs to work on broadening her differential diagnoses. Her medical knowledge is at what I would expect for her level and she occasionally answered questions during rounds. She did a good job with her follow-up presentations, they were concise and relevant. Many times our teams split for follow-ups, so I didn't see her present that often. 

Fund of knowledge Very good fund of knowledge and was clearly interested in learning and integrating new information.
Patient care skills: Histories were always thorough and trustworthy. Never missed any relevant physical exam findings.
Presentations: Lavender really excelled at patient presentations. She was thorough without going into excessive detail. The assessments and plans were on the level of what we often see from interns. Really outstanding.
Communication skills: She communicated very effectively with staff and with patients. She has a quiet calm about her that I think the patients appreciate and find comforting. This forms the basis of a really outstanding bedside manner.
Professionalism Clearly extremely mature and professional. She worked well within the team structure. Clearly understood her role in patient care as a learner and member of the team.
Team work: Again, she is a consummate team player and worked well with everyone. In terms of maturity/professionalism, etc. she is one of the best students that I have ever worked with.
Teaching: As above, she didn't speak much on rounds at first, but as she got more comfortable with the flow of the service, was highly effective at teaching what she knew. 
I know that she is deciding between surgery and medicine. I think she has all of the tools to be highly successful at either and she is the type of person we should recruit to stay here for residency.  

Fund of knowledge: Outstanding fund of knowledge and a well-developed ability to apply it to complex clinical presentations.  
Patient care skills: A thoughtful, disciplined provider who in a quiet way was quite impressive with regard to the outstanding overall care she provided. Kind to patients, appropriately forceful when advocating on their behalf, careful to leave no issue unresolved in her effort to advance patient care.
Presentations: Always well-constructed, thorough, and delivered in an efficient and clear fLavenderion. 
Communication skills: Excellent. Able to listen as well as convey ideas/concerns with a minimum of extraneous flourishes. I enjoyed listening to her express her ideas with an efficiency that was appreciated, especially on particularly busy days.
Professionalism: Top-notch. Lavender clearly approaches both her education and clinical duties with a profound respect for patients, peers, and overall clinical process. 
Team work: Superb. A highly valued member of the team who made significant contributions in both direct clinical care and during rounds.
Teaching: A thoughtful contributor on rounds who I suspect was capable of adding additional insights but was finding her feet with regard to when she thought her contributions might be valuable. I would encourage her to trust her instincts and contribute more often as I often found her insights to be particularly valuable. ","Brown, Lavender",Lavender,Brown,,8/11/17,2017,5,0.2,G,General,"Brown, David"

Fund of knowledge: Oliver had a very impressive fund of knowledge and demonstrated this through his presentations, notes, and thorough understanding of his patients and pathophysiology pertinent to their disease processes. He had great curiosity and continued to build on his knowledgebase by continuing to read broadly and refer to pertinent literature. 
Patient care skills: Oliver was well liked by his patients and demonstrated excellent empathy and care for them. He was viewed by many as one of the primary caregivers, and his patients appeared to greatly trust his ability to help and care for them. His ability to collect and analyze information was superb, and he continued to strengthen his skills in physical diagnosis and examination. 
Presentations: Presentations on rounds continued to improve throughout the course of the rotation. By the end of the rotation, Oliver presented largely from memory. 
Communication skills: His communication skills were excellent, whether with primary team, consultants, or multidisciplinary staff. 
Professionalism: Oliver demonstrated great professionalism throughout the rotation. 
Team work: Oliver was a superb team player and was always willing to help. He grew to be an integral part of the group, and helped the team manage a busy workload.  
Teaching: He readily brought literature to the team's attention, and was eager to research and teach regarding the pathophysiology behind processes pertinent to his patients.  

I had the pleasure of working with Oliver Wood on the Gen Med 1 service. I think he was one of the strongest students that I have worked with this year and I want to give him a superior endorsement. His fund of knowledge was superior. Oliver proved early on that his understanding of pathophysiology was more on par with that of an early intern than of his peer medical students. His differential diagnoses were broad but also reasonable. In his workup of patients, I was particularly impressed by his thoroughness. When his patient had 10 different problems to address, he did not push aside the 1-2 problems he did not understand. Instead, he brought them to the attention of the team and tried to explain them using research and reading he had done on his own time. I was particularly impressed by his exploration of macrocytic anemia which he presented on rounds without having to be asking to present. It was a thorough and thoughtful presentation which did actually contribute to the care of his patient who had an unexplained macrocytosis. Olivers' strong fund of knowledge also meant that he was able to carry more patients than his peers. There was a day where I as the intern had to leave town and a different intern was covering for me, and Oliver used this as an opportunity to show that he could cover more than half of our service that morning on rounds. The covering intern told me after the fact that she was very impressed and found his contributions helpful. Oliver was a strong team player and enthusiastic contributor to patient care. His patients often said they felt most comfortable with him and he went out of his way to spend more time with them. At the start of the rotation, Oliver's presentations were strong but required more precision. He was given feedback about how to be less verbose and more direct with his speaking and he incorporated this feedback with enthusiasm, improving his presentation skills immensely by the end of the rotation. He also asked for feedback on multiple occasions and was always receptive and responsive to thoughts for improvement (although they were very few!). He will make an exceptionally compassionate and intelligent doctor, and I hope he considers internal medicine because I know he would thrive. 

Oliver presented very well and knew his patients inside and out. Even when he was following about half the team's list by the end of the rotation, his knowledge of each patient was very thorough. He was definitely operating at a sub-I level. 

Oliver was an excellent student who was easy to work with and clearly has a superior fund of knowledge. He was good at anticipating what work he could help with and going the extra mile when needed, for example to type up records so that they would be permanent in the chart after obtaining the paperwork himself. His presentations were from memory and thorough. He was however a bit too focused on learning how to be an intern and still has a long way to go in terms of learning to pick out important details and evaluate the big picture. He also did not seem to like being corrected or being taught something new (whether it was a concept, skill or about medication) particularly from the residents, insisting that he already knew the answers. I think this could be corrected with a bit more humility and communication with his team members about the patients before rounds. I did not see him teach directly but saw his handout which was excellent. Overall, a very advanced student. 

Oliver is definitely knowledgeable beyond his years as a medical student. He has a great understanding of his patients and their active issues. Oliver is incredibly inquisitive, while I feel that this is an excellent quality to have as a medical student, I caution him that his questions can at times feel challenging. It is important to understand his place as the medical student on the team, and while he should always ask questions, be curious and thoughtful (and he was), I want to make him aware of this for the future. He delivered two excellent presentations throughout my time with him, followed very complex patients, and helped lighten my work as a resident. He was great to work with.

Similarly, he was an absolute pleasure to have in my preceptorship group. Gregory is a kind and conscientious medical student who is committed to self-improvement and to patient care.  He regularly requests feedback and is dedicated in his efforts to incorporate it into all that he does in real time. His fund of knowledge is excellent.  He is proactive in his learning and was commended for actively sharing his knowledge with his team in the form of summaries of clinically relevant studies or short presentations on pertinent topics. While Gregory is very knowledgeable he sometimes holds back. When I asked why he doesn't always speak up he stated he wanted to give everyone an opportunity to answer questions. His response speaks to his thoughtfulness, which is visible both in how he relates to his classmates and team members and in how he related to his patients and their families. His considerate disposition, enthusiasm, and willingness to help forward patient care made him a  strong asset to the medical team and a pleasure to work with.  Gregory took ownership of his patients and took the time to cultivate relationships with each of them. He was routinely regarded as their primary contact person on the team. One of his attendings noted that she ""was quite impressed in frequently and regularly seeing him sitting at the bedside of his patients at various times of the day rather than glued to a hospital computer. He visited patients and family even when not necessary and spent time getting to know them, helping them understand their hospital course and offering comfort in difficult situations. This level caring and compassion set him apart not only from other students but from the residents as well.""  His commitment to his patients was also illustrated by his profound attention to detail. His histories were unbelievably comprehensive giving one the sense that there was not a single detail about the patients medical history that Gregory did not know. Additionally, Gregory was a clear advocate of this patients and always put their needs first. One of his residents noted that Gregory was attempting to make a follow up appointment for a patient, but was unable to get through to the physician's office. Instead of giving up, Gregory went to the physician's office himself and spoke directly with the secretary to schedule the appointment. Gregorys physical exam skill were also quite good and appropriately comprehensive. His write-up were always thorough, albeit occasionally too detailed. However, he was diligent in his efforts to be more concise and demonstrated steady improvement in this area. His assessment demonstrated strong clinical reasoning skills and the effective use of the literature and his plans were comprehensive, reflecting an understanding of the details of clinical management that exceeded his level of training. His presentations were effectively communicated and easy to follow and as his confidence grows that will undoubtedly continue to improve.","Goyle, Gregory",Gregory,Goyle,1,6/30/17,2017,4,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

I am writing to evaluate Gregory Goyle on the Oncology service. Pat was one of the best medical students I have had the pleasure of working with. In every facet, Pat was excellent. Starting with his fund of knowledge, Pat was totally on top of his game. In one instance, a patient had new AFib right prior to his AM presentation. He took this new information in stride and quickly formulated an accurate and efficient plan for his patient. He showed great ownership of his patients. He knew the most information about his patients, had this information ready at a moment's notice. I had the opportunity to see him speak and interact with several patients. He demonstrated excellent bed side manner, and was always putting his patient's needs first. His presentations were excellent as well. We worked on building his confidence with his presentations and cutting out the extraneous information, and he responded to feedback excellently. He was always putting the team's needs first. In one instance, he was attempting to make a follow up appointment for a patient, but was unable to get through to the physician's office. Instead of giving up, Pat went to the physician's office himself and spoke directly with the secretary to schedule the appointment. He was constantly showing this ability to go above and beyond. Finally, Pat was frequently participating in learning and would use this information to teach the team about subjects related to his patients. Pat was in the top 5% of medical students I have worked with and has a bright future in whatever field he chooses. 

Gregory is one of the best medical students I have ever worked with. Gregory is extremely intelligent and curious and has an excellent hold on the pathophysiology behind the medical problems his patients had. On his own accord, Gregory would bring in articles to share with the team, which proved to be highly informative and relevant, and even further demonstrated his intellectual curiosity and dedication towards learning. He is very proactive and reliable. His presentations were excellent. He was always clear, accurate and succinct and I enjoyed hearing him present each morning.  Not only is Gregory strong in his knowledge and presentations, but he also is highly dedicated to his patients and established amazing rapport with them. In particular, he formed a bond with a patient that could only be formed by someone who truly is dedicated to their patients, and I could tell the patient was more at ease when Gregory was around. Overall, Gregory performed at the level even greater than a subI, and he will be successful in any speciality he chooses and his colleagues will be lucky to have him as part of their team. 

Fund of knowledge:
I was impressed by Gregory's strong fund of knowledge as well as his curiosity. When new questions came up, Gregory with frequently seek out the answers in the literature and other resources to share with the team. 
Patient care skills / Presentations / Communication skills: 
I could rely on Gregory to accurately and insightfully report on his patients' conditions and concerns throughout the day, and it was clear that they relied on him as their main point person on the team. Gregory's presentations on were frequently from memory and polished. His notes, in particular his admission notes, were thorough, detailed, and insightful. He was able to focus on the active problems at hand while discussing a broad and thoughtful differential when asked further. Further, Gregory effectively communicated disposition plans for his patients on multi-disciplinary rounds and the plan with nurses/therapists/team members during the day.
Professionalism:
Gregory was proactive and asked for feedback several times through his rotation. He quickly adapted and integrated the feedback in real time.  
Team work: 
Gregory was a strong asset to our medical team. Even as a med student early in his third year, he demonstrated a keen understanding of the structure of the team and the flow of the day, and he was very willing to contribute in whatever way would move forward patient care, from obtaining outside collateral to reviewing discharge instructions with a patient. Lastly, he maintained a genuine and cheerful attitude that made him a joy to teach and work with.
Teaching: 
Gregory led several very helpful teaching sessions, including a helpful overview of pulmonary hypertension. 
Overall, it was a pleasure to have Gregory on our team, and I hope he chooses internal medicine for residency! 


Gregory was a kind, thoughtful medical student on my sister team, who was clearly very dedicated and helpful.

ATTENDINGS

Gregory is extremely kind, sincere, and thoughtful.  He carried several patients with complex physiology and demonstrated an excellent understanding of their key issues.  Gregory is on top of all details, and communicates very clearly.  His case presentations were informative and demonstrated comprehensiveness and thoughtfulness. He worked well and easily integrated into the team. He was curious about learning and asked good questions. He was asked to research a couple of topics, and his presentations were tailored to our questions and needs.  He is professional and worked well with our entire multiD team. 
My feedback to Gregory is to keep working on making his day to day presentation more concise. Gregory is self aware and already knew this is an area to keep working on. 

I worked most closely with Gregory Goyle. He was an outstanding student and worked hard to continually improve during the rotation. He asked for feedback, made himself an integral part of the team and helped the team function smoothly. Several times each week he would share a relevant study or discuss disease pathogenesis and management pertinent to his patients. Patient presentations were thorough, all pertinent information was given and assessment and plan were well thought out and organized. There could be a tiny bit of room for improvement in making his presentations more fluent and polished but I am certain that this will come together as he matures. I was quite impressed in frequently and regularly seeing him sitting at the bedside of his patients at various times of the day rather than glued to a hospital computer. He visited patients and family even when not necessary and spent time getting to know them, helping them understand their hospital course and offering comfort in difficult situations. This level caring and compassion set him apart not only from other students but from the residents as well. 

Gregory: During my 2 weeks on-service, Pat presented 3-4 new admissions and consistently presented 2-3 follow-ups per day. His presentations were clear and concise with an appropriate amount of detail. He has an excellent fund of knowledge. Very professional and a good team player. He would frequently present articles relevant to his cases. ","Goyle, Gregory",Gregory,Goyle,1,6/30/17,2017,4,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

Viktor is one of the most outstanding medical students I've had the privilege to work with. He is first and foremost a kind-souled person who genuinely cared about the physical and emotional well-being of patients. He always spent extra time talking with his patients to make sure that their questions were addressed and they were kept in the loop about their treatment course. When interviewing patients he was thorough, systematic and efficient. He took the time to uncover relevant information that otherwise can get missed in the daily hustle and bustle of the residents. I was especially impressed that he took the initiative to check in on patients after they were discharged to make sure they were doing ok and had good transitions to care outside the hospital. Viktor is very polite and modest, yet he has an excellent fund of knowledge. He works beautifully with his peers, the other residents and other members of the care team. He also sought out feedback and was able to improve a lot (though he's already great to start with). 

Viktor was on the other team, so I didn't work as closely with him. However I found his presentations very clear and thoughtful, and he worked well with his team. 

Viktor: Dedicated, thoughtful, very attentive to details.  He was friendly, easy to get along with, and enjoyed learning.  He contributed during rounds in a meaningful way, and was always ready to help out with floor tasks.  He took great care of his patients and didn't miss any details.  Almost better than the intern!  He'll do well in whatever field he chooses, and I'm confident he will grow into a fine physician.  

I had limited interaction with Viktor since he was on the sister team, but his presentations were clear and concise and seems to know his patients very well. 

-Did multiple (at least 3 that I can recall) brief presentations on rounds, showing initiative each time in coming up with topics pertinent to our patients. Appreciated that, rather than choosing broad, generic topics, he focused on specific questions important to our patients' care - for example, we were struggling with the question of how long to anticoagulate a patient with Impella-induced clot - he did a thorough search of relevant literature and case reports.
-Demonstrated outstanding curiosity and was a highly motivated, enthusiastic team player
-Worked very hard on his presentations and it showed; did a great job incorporating resident feedback to give well-organized, thorough admission presentations on rounds. Our attending commented after one of his presentations ""it makes my job easy when the presentations are like that...it would be great if all the resident presentations were done the same"" - speaking specifically to his polished , organized, efficient presentation style
-Took initiative to  help the team get the work done - called patients/family/outside hospital often before being asked to do so; did a great job communicating with nurses/staff/consultants
-In terms of history taking and physical, in the top quarter of his peers; great job, went the ""extra mile"" (e.g. getting detailed social hx, doing MMSE, orthostatics) 
-Great patient rapport - knew his patients very well and demonstrated compassion - well liked by team members, patients and staff. 

Viktor was on the sister team. 
He gave well organized and thoughtful presentations that were at the level of an intern. 

Having Viktor as a medical student on cardiology was one of the greatest gifts I could have imagined in my first two weeks of residency. He truly was a team member who contributed to excellent patient care, improved length of patient stay outcomes by facilitating discharges with us, and was an outstanding advocate for his patients. In what could have been a very tenuous time for patient care given transitions of roles at this time of year, he was of invaluable assistance in keeping the team moving forward.
In terms of fund of knowledge and curiosity, Viktor was diligent in reading about his patients, keeping abreast of current clinical knowledge and also, especially towards the end of his weeks with us, offering suggestions for management. He was constantly asking questions, taking initiative to really understand underlying pathophysiology, and often enlightening the team in cases of more esoteric medical presentations. He stood up well to rigorous questioning from none other than the director of the Internal Medicine program.
In terms of patient care skills, this was one of the areas where I watched Viktor improve over time. As his intern, I watched him pre round with me every day, and saw him begin to be able to synthesize information and exam findings into a clinical picture (I.e. Assessing volume status and using that to create a plan). And most of all, I watched him create outstanding patient relationships and blossom in confidence and competence in them, most notably with a pregnant patient who above all, needed an advocate; and again with a young man with new onset heart failure. In the second case, he was the one who began the motivational interviewing process to understand the management of his new chronic disease as well as the one to break bad news to him. 
Viktor's presentations, as the block went on, became increasingly confident and relevant, especially in the extremely difficult setting of advanced heart failure rounds. By the end, he was appropriately reporting his HPI and Assessment/Plans from memory. 
Viktor was an outstanding and trusted communicator- myself and the senior resident often trusted him to return pages, communicate with consults, and lead patient discharge discussions, for example. I can say with full confidence that I would not trust many students to do this. 
Overall, working with Viktor was a joy. He was consistently present, excited to learn, involved with his patient's care, a trusted member of the team, and came in every day with a positive attitude. He made what could have been an extremely stressful first two weeks of intern year much less stressful. I'm excited to see him grow, gain confidence, and hopefully join us here as a medicine resident one day soon.  

Viktor is an extraordinary student and future physician. Several days after he has been off service, his patients are still asking about him and his team is still talking about what an outstanding job he did during his medicine rotation. Viktor takes ownership of his patients and his patients see him as their care provider. He worked tirelessly throughout the month to know everything about his patients and contribute meaningful to their care. He thought critically about their medical problems and took every opportunity to learn. He was such a joy to work with as a team member everyday: he was always prepared, conscientious, and upbeat. He not only helped take care of the patients he was following but was actively involved with all of the patients and eager to help in any way he could. He often did things we out even being asked and anticipated next steps in patient care. His presentations were excellent and demonstrated his understanding about all of the active issues for his patients. Viktor will thrive in whatever field he chooses to pursue and I hope he goes into medicine.  

ATTENDINGS

Viktor was truly an outstanding medical student, among one of the best medical students I have worked with up to this time as an attending. In each presentation he gave, he never missed any pertinent detail and yet remained concise and could summarize complicated data with ease. That ability to be very thorough and yet always grasp big picture is a skill I ask even our interns or residents to grasp and he seemed to have it so early in his training. His topic presentations demonstrated his innate skills as an educator- being sure to connect teaching to patient cases and illustrating how to incorporate evidence into next steps in management. 
 
Viktor's strengths included his level of professionalism, his ability to synthesize complicated information succinctly and his ability to work well with the team. He received numerous compliments from patients and families about his empathy and professional manner. He has a strong fund of knowledge. I was particularly impressed with his curiosity and growth over the few weeks I worked with him. 

Krum:   Mature, solid fund of knowledge, eager to research topics and present appropriately, excellent patient rapport.  Worked productively with his team. Took feedback well.  Mr. Krum exceeded standards of medical knowledge, patient care, teamwork, communication on this portion of his rotation. 

Viktor Krum is the medical student who was specifically assigned to my resident team and he is truly one of the best students I have ever had the privilege of working with.  I cannot say enough good things about him, he functioned at the level of a highly functional intern. Viktor is kind, conscientious, intelligent, thoughtful, knowledgeable and a fantastic team player. He established amazing therapeutic relationships with his patients and was instrumental in providing care to them. His thirst for knowledge is admirable and he truly represents the ideal medical student.  Giving him honors really doesn't do justice to his level of competence. If there is some award at graduation for the best student on the medical service he should receive it. Hopefully we can convince him to pursue internal medicine and stay here at CUMC.  ","Krum, Viktor",Viktor,Krum,2,6/30/17,2017,4,0.6,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

ATTENDINGS

Dean Dean: 
Fund of knowledge: Dean demonstrated a very strong fund of knowledge, especially as he is still early in his clinical clerkships. He is able to apply this knowledge towards formulating a thorough assessment and plan for each relevant medical issue. 
Patient care skills: Dean performed thorough histories and physicals on new admissions and focused examinations on follow ups. He is open to feedback on his physical examination skills. He is eager to be involved in patient care and willing to help the team in any way he can. 
Presentations: Presentations were succinct and focused on rounds, and he required minimal referral to his notes. He presented in a clear and confident manner, and overall his presentations were well above average for a third year student.  
Communication skills: Superb communication skills with patients that helped him develop strong rapport. Also did an excellent job communicating with the health care team. He was definitely 'value-added' on the team. 
Professionalism: Always on time, enthusiastic to help out, actively solicited feedback from the residents. Was inquisitive during rounds but was respectful of / did not interrupt his fellow students' presentations. 
Team work: Communicated really well with the team including nurses on the floor and made every effort to be helpful to the residents without obstructing the work flow. He got along well with the other students on the team. 
Teaching: Made a fantastic oral presentation on cholangiocarcinoma, including the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of the disease. In addition to providing a great overview of the disease, he also summarized a couple of important publications.  

Dean Dean: Dean was actively engaged on rounds demonstrating curiosity and asking appropriate questions for all patients discussed on rounds. He also demonstrated a very good and appropriate fund of knowledge. He was extremely courteous and professional at all times. Presentations were exceptionally thorough, accurate, and detail oriented. He communicated clearly and articulated an organized H&P. However, presentations were very long and could be more concise--I could tell that Dean was working on this even without feedback as I noted he would set his watch in from to him to time himself. Additionally, presentations somewhat relied on reading notes, print outs. I did not directly observe physical exam skills. He was a positive and engaged team member. Overall, I think Dean did a great job! 

Fund of knowledge very good
Patient care skills: very good
Presentations: very good; could have been more proactive when interacting with patients during rounds - tended to defer to the residents rather than lead the interaction
Communication skills: excellent; I particularly liked that at the end of my rotation, Dean asked for us to meet to discuss any specific feedback/criticisms I had 
Professionalism excellent
Team work: not sufficient contact to assess 
Teaching: not sufficient contact to assess 

Fund of knowledge. Good fund of knowledge for his level was comfortable with our topics of discussion. 
Patient care skills: Dean actively followed a number of patients during his tenure on GenMed2, and his presentations reflected a thoughtful, careful approach to history and examination. His differentials were clear and mostly correct. His interpretation of the data reflect a strong fund of book knowledge. 
Presentations: Presentations left me in little doubt what was going on with the patient, and we as a team were confident with his care of the patient. 
Communication skills: Clear, concise, engaging with the team. 
Professionalism Very professional, no complaints from the patients. 
Team work: Worked well as a part of the team 
Teaching: Presented a topic for the group on his last day - it was well researched, thoughtfully compiled, and eloquently expressed. Well done. ","Thomas, Dean",Dean,Thomas,1,6/30/17,2017,4,,G,General,"Brown, David"

Luna is a wonderful medical student. I was very impressed with her fund of knowledge and level of investment in her patients' care. She presented clearly and concisely, and was able to summarize and synthesize very complex information (including several particularly complicated ICU transfers with multiple medical and surgical comorbidities). She displayed excellent clinical reasoning skills, and was tremendously helpful to me on the floors, taking the initiative time and again to follow-through with nurses to make sure things got done, to get on the phone with consultants directly, and even to challenge the team's thinking and ask for rationalization for a given management decision, which is really above and beyond what is expected of a medical student!  

Luna (Luna) exhibited a vast fund of knowledge that she applied very meticulously during her clinical encounters on the infectious disease service. She was motivated to see patients on her own and was always willing to go beyond to help the team. She actively sought feedback. Her presentations were clear, accurate and concise while her notes were also very thorough.  

I had the pleasure of having Luna  on my team during her Medicine rotation. I would consider Luna to be one of the best medical students I have worked with. Luna has both a strong fund of clinical knowledge as well as a high level of intellectual curiosity which kept her engaged during our Medicine rounds. Besides carrying her own 3 patients, Luna followed along with the courses of all the other patients on the team and was eager to engage in PM bedside rounds on the other patients. As a medical student, Luna exceeded the responsibilities that were required of her. Early on, she assumed full ownership of all of her patients and began placing lab/imaging orders, repleting patients' electrolytes, calling consults, making appointments, and writing discharge summaries. In terms of her notes and presentations, her HPIs were very organized and succinct, her physical exams were detailed but focused, and her assessments and plans were well thought out. She gave two excellent presentations during her rotation (one on pancreatitis and the other on cholangitis/choledocholithiasis) which both provided the residents an appropriate level of learning. Lastly, Luna is very easy to get along with and a team player. She worked well with the housestaff and did an excellent job of communicating with the nurses to ensure that her patients would be taken care of. We came to think of her as an integral part of our team. Additionally, patients often commented that she was nice/sweet/pleasant and that she was able to clearly explain to them their medical conditions and plans of care. Luna will do well in any specialty she chooses, and any specialty would be lucky to have her.

Presentations: Luna gave very comprehensive and accurate presentations, clearly demonstrating she had spent significant time learning about her patients and performing comprehensive histories and physicals. She can still work on making her presentations a little more concise and organized, highlighting some of the more relevant elements and leaving out those elements that are somewhat superfluous.
Professionalism: Luna was positive and really a pleasure to work with.
Team work: Luna was a great team member, and was very helpful with her own patients as well as those she wasn't even following directly.
Teaching: Luna gave us a great presentation on pancreatitis, that nicely summarized her own patient's presentation while also giving a really great outline of the differential diagnosis and basic management principles of pancreatitis. 

Luna:
Fund of knowledge  excellent
Patient care skills:  very good, great rapport with patients
Presentations: clear, accurate, succinct, from memory  
Communication skills: excellent
Professionalism and attitude excellent
Team work: great team player
Teaching: great skills in sharing knowledge with the team and fellow students 

Luna was a pleasure to work with and a very strong, dedicated medical student. She demonstrated a strong grasp of medical knowledge and curiosity to learn about her patients' medical conditions, including preparing and leading short presentations for the team. She was very hardworking and took the initiative to complete workday tasks and participate in the medical care of her patients. Her presentations were notably concise, well-organized, and well prepared. She also demonstrated an impressive level of empathy and maturity when dealing with her patients. Overall, she operated at intern-level and was a very integral member of our team. It would be my pleasure to work with her again. 

ATTENDINGS

Luna did an excellent job on her rotation with the ID service. I was impressed with Luna's ability to get ""the big picture"" when presenting her patients from memory while still having command of details when asked. She was quite efficient in her presentations and contributed greatly to rounds. 

Fund of knowledge: Very strong. Luna demonstrated good basic skills in general medicine and a strong motivation to expand her knowledge of infectious diseases.
Patient care skills: Luna excelled in this area. In addition to meticulous history and exam-taking, she took the time to collect history from a broad range of sources, including the PMD, family, and outside hospital records, which she succinctly summarized and integrated into her presentations.
Presentations: Presentations were great and her assessments demonstrated a clear thought process. Would encourage her to work on making her presentations more concise as she is doing.  
Communication skills: Luna connected very well with her patients and communicated well with the team. She has a rather quiet demeanor but asserted herself effectively particularly as she became more comfortable during the rotation; I would encourage her to continue to do this!
Professionalism: Luna was a pleasure to work with and demonstrated a strong sense of professionalism and humility. She was highly respectful of patients and staff and had a great disposition on rounds.
Team work: Great team player. She did tons of leg work to help advance the care of her patients.
Teaching: Also showed evidence of researching relevant topics for her case presentations. I would encourage her to continue to expand her knowledge base and share what she has learned with the team. 

Luna stands out in terms of her ability to succinctly and accurately evaluate and formulate cases.  She has an excellent fund of knowledge and a terrific ability to present the key features of in a most careful and succinct manner without sacrificing the most important and relevant case features.  She consistently identified history and physical findings that others on the team may have overlooked, and showed an advanced understanding of their relevance. Such skills are certainly beyond her current level of training.  She demonstrated terrific team collaboration.  Luna seems tireless in her pursuit of excellence and based on my experience, will make an outstanding resident and attending physician. 

Fund of knowledge Good fund of knowledge for her level of training. 
Patient care skills: Provided very good follow up for her patients. 
Presentations: As above, the one presentation I did hear her give was excellent, the case was very complex and she managed to summarize the details and the overview very well. 
Professionalism and attitude: She is poised and confident. She has a somewhat informal manner 
Team work She was very eager to help the team, made every effort to make sure results were followed up. On one occasion a patient's clinical care was dependent on pathology results, she spoke daily with the pathologist and made it such that a clinical decision was arrived at in a timely fashion. 
Teaching: She gave a presentation on the various causes of hypothermia that was somewhat disorganized but ultimately helpful to the care of the patient. It was overall a good attempt given the time constraints. 

Luna was a pleasure to have on our team.  She was enthusiastic, detail-oriented, and professional.  Her daily presentations were excellent and she was very diligent in the care and follow-up of some complex patients.  She developed wonderful relationships with her patients and served as a key member of the care team.  She gave us a nice, concise presentation on a topic that was applicable to many of our patients.  ","Lovegood, Luna",Luna,Lovegood,,9/22/17,2017,6,0.4,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Seamus was engaged, took responsibility for our whole patient list and was a pleasure to work with. In addition to excellent presentations on the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension and an overview of digoxin and digoxin toxicity, Seamus was clearly invested in his patients. He spent an hour explaining the intricacies of pacemaker placement to a critically ill patient, exhibiting a kind bedside manner with an impressive ability to make complicated medical problems understandable. He will be an excellent doctor in any field but his passion of detail and physiology would make him a wonderful internal medicine physician. 

Fund of knowledge: Seamus always demonstrated a great depth of
knowledge. He had great differential diagnoses on his own patients and added to the differentials of patients that were not his own. He was able to interpret imaging and laboratory testing at a level of an intern. 
Patient care skills: Seamus expressed a desire to continuously improve his physical exam skills and was able to recognize findings quite well. He picked up subtle changes in his patients' volume status that subsequently influenced treatment plans and also picked up findings that aided in the differential diagnosis. In particular one of his patients with pulmonary hypertension that had acutely worsened, Seamus recognized the signs of right sided heart failure readily, and attempted to identify more advanced signs. 
Presenting: Seamus showed great improvement during his rotation on his presentations. They were succinct yet mentioned the most critical information when reporting progress. His admission presentations were thorough and necessarily detailed. 
Communication skills: I will not forget a particular instance when Seamus dealt with a difficult patient who was certainly in need of a pacemaker. Seamus appreciated the urgency of this therapy and was able to communicate this effectively to the patient. He went above and beyond spending over one hour with this patient, retrieving critical information about why the patient was hesitant and showed his mastery of the cultural competency required to practice medicine in New York City.
Professionalism: Seamus demonstrated superb professionalism during his rotation. He exemplified the nurturing yet objective role of the physician. He was polished in front of his patients and respectful when dealing with nursing and social work. 
Teamwork: Seamus was an advocate for his patient and functioned as an intern during interdisciplinary rounds. He provided critical information that helped his patients have a safe discharge and even interacted with insurance companies to ensure that his patient would receive the necessary medications. Truly stellar in this regard. 
Teaching: excellent, residency level teaching. Our whole team learned from
his discussions on findings on physical exam pertaining to a critically ill patient on our service. He was also an excellent teacher for the patients, taking his time to explain risks and benefits of treatment and invasive procedures.  


ATTENDINGS

Mr. Finnigan's case presentations were clear and succinct without missing relevant data. He also showed outstanding fund of knowledge. 

I primarily worked with Seamus Finnigan on the Cardiology B Service.  Seamus's fund of knowledge is excellent, and he was eager to learn more on the rotation each day.  Seamus has tremendous enthusiasm for cardiology, and he took advantage of all opportunities to learn about different areas of subspecialty, as he followed his patients to EP, cardiac cath, echo, etc.  He knew his patients very well and used pathophysiological concepts to describe the clinical manifestations of disease processes.  For example, he clearly explained the difference in WHO classification for patients with pulmonary hypertension related to systemic v. limited scleroderma.  Seamus gave an outstanding presentation on Digoxin.  His professionalism is commendable.  He earned the respect of his house staff colleagues, and he was given significant responsibility as a reliable team player.  As a team, we were very impressed by Seamus's determination and focus to achieve his career goals.  Seamus's dedication to medicine and his passion for cardiology inspired the entire team and set the tone for a fantastic month.  He was a pleasure to have on the Cardiology Service. 

Seamus did an excellent job on the General Medicine 1 rotation. I served as the attending for the ""sister"" team - and so did not have as much of an opportunity to observe Seamus in day to day interactions as the other attending on service and so would defer to him for a more complete evaluation-but I had the opportunity to observe and work with Seamus on rounds and during teaching sessions. He demonstrated exceptional curiosity and an eagerness to learn, and did an excellent job with 2 10 minute presentations during rounds, displaying great ability to compile and interpret relevant literature. He was very self-directed and took ""ownership"" over the patients that he followed, serving often as the point person in discussions with the family and with nursing staff. In patient interactions, he was tactful, thorough, and sensitive; his presentations on rounds improved thanks to his hard work and by the end of the rotation he was presenting at the sub-I level. Overall, he was a pleasure to work with and the team benefitted greatly from his enthusiasm and hard work. ","Finnigan, Seamus",Seamus,Finnigan,,9/22/17,2017,6,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

His ROS and PE were very thorough, and focused on what was appropriately needed for his differential. His differential was excellent, yet through; I appreciated that he thought about other important considerations rather than just focusing on the one seemingly obvious reason for the patient's admission.

Draco was an amazing medical student.   
His fund of knowledge was deep and expansive.  He regularly impressed me and my attending with his knowledge of topics and pathophys.  I began to expect him to have the answer more often than my interns.  His patient care skills were good.  He took detailed histories and physicals and took ownership over the care of his patients.  His presentation skills are truly impressive.  He is able to clearly and succinctly deliver information.  He is both complete and concise.  He contributes to getting tasks done for his patients.  He is also a good teacher giving great presentations to the team.   

Draco had a phenomenal fund of knowledge.  He was able to dissect very complex patient presentations and present them to the attending in a coherent and complete manner.   He has undoubtedly a very bright future in whichever specialty he chooses to pursue. 

While I did not work with Draco directly (he was the med student for my sister team), I was consistently impressed with his patient presentations. They were always terrifically organized, thoughtful, and confidently delivered, with appropriate and accurate interpretations of data. He is clearly a very bright, enthusiastic person with a gift for sharing information.

Draco's written case presentations have been thoughtful and organized. He has been able to get to know each of his patients and tell their story while maintaining the structure required for a medical write-up. The sections on the History of Present Illness and Past Medical History grew in their level of organization and detail throughout the course, and the final write-ups provided comprehensive assessments in these areas.  Additionally, Draco worked hard on the format and completeness of the physical examination section, so that this section progressed to become a thorough and excellent aspect of his presentations. From the beginning of the course, Draco has had an impressive grasp of the overall picture relating to each patient's presentation. Draco developed assessment/differential diagnosis sections that were thorough and structured and detailed systematic plan sections that addressed the patients' many issues and addressed diagnosis, treatment and monitoring goals.

Her topic presentations were well-researched and included the latest literature. She was incredibly helpful to the medical team. Katie should continue to read about her patients, and can strive to take more initiative in proactively working on tasks to help the team. Overall a great job on this rotation.

Communication skills: again, outstanding.  
Professionalism: excellent, with a great attitude.
Team work: works very well with others.  
Teaching: gave 2 excellent presentations with well-referenced handouts that were very instructive to the entire team.

Dudley was a great medical student and an important addition to our medical team. He always had an upbeat, positive attitude and was eager to help out. His topic presentations were well-researched and applicable to discussions we had on rounds. 

Dudley is great! He is incredibly engaged and helpful. He had a very broad base of medical knowledge and is always looking for opportunities to learn more and to teach the team about the things he's learned. His patients loved him and he went out of his way to take care of the little things for his patients - one of his patients was on a lot of pain meds and was having difficulty remembering things, so Dudley brought him a little notebook and pen for him to write things down, and he was so thrilled to have it. Dudley was a great addition to the team! 

Fund of knowledge: Dudley never lacked the curiosity or motivation to learn relevant internal medicine clinical knowledge. I do feel at time there could have been a better understanding of the pathophysiology, however I mostly chalk this up to not having completed Step 1.  Overall from start to finish he worked hard at improving his knowledge and definitely become more effective in doing so. 
Patient care skills: Personally I felt he preformed this task adequately. Due to the new admitting guidelines within the general ward service, we at times lacked new admission. Furthermore, due to rounds in the morning and several afternoon didactic, it was hard to assess his skills as it did not flow within the daily schedule and I did not want him to stay later than necessary.   
Presentations: Accurate and clear, at times could be more from memory and more succinct.   
Communication skills: Absolutely wonderful job, interpersonal skills are one of Dudley's strongest characteristics. I really felt he was genuine it all his interactions and his respect for everyone was contagious. 
Professionalism Wonderful attitude and always willing to go the extra mile for patient care. 
Team work: Another one of Dudley's strongest traits. He worked effortlessly within the team construct and always was willing to help both the residents as well as the fellow students. 
Teaching: Difficult to completely assess, but is presentations and handouts were on point, especially his topic review on ATN, where he digested several very complex and detailed journals. 

Dudley was an excellent medical student. He was extremely positive and engaged. He clearly was enthusiastic and worked very hard to get to know his patients well throughout the rotation. He advocated for his patients at every possible time. He clearly read throughout the rotation, working to learn more about his patients and learn about pathophysiology. I had a great experience working with him and he will be a phenomenal physician!



I worked primarily with Dudley, who is an exceptional medical student. From day 1, he asked me to set expectations and met or exceeded all of them thereafter. He was organized, comprehensive, diligent, and compassionate. He was universally and deeply liked - his patients inquired after him when he left, nurses approached me about his impeccable professionalism and communication, and our team as well as neighboring teams remarked frequently on how well he was doing. Many patients, nurses, and residents have said that Dudley is one of the best medical students they have seen.  
Dudley revealed exceptional medical knowledge, answering questions easily about his own patients as well as general oncology topics. In particular, Dudley presented a new patient with prostate cancer and had clearly done a very comprehensive review of the subject, answering questions about pathophysiology, genetics, staging, treatment, medical history/anthropology and more. When a question was finally discovered that stumped him, it turned out that no one else in the room knew the answer. Dudley told me he had set the goal of learning from his patients and he clearly did - he is more expert in the disease processes that he saw on this rotation than I am.
Dudley was an absolute joy to work with, and I hope that he considers a future in internal medicine. Any field or program will be lucky to have this exceptional student. 


ATTENDINGS

Fund of knowledge:  Dudley is very enthusiastic and eager, which made him a pleasure to have on the team.  I think he can continue to improve his knowledge base, specifically focusing on pathophysiology.  
Patient care skills/presentations:  Dudley is very thorough and has an excellent bedside manner.  He should continue to work on his presentation skills- specifically re: organization of information, working on not repeating himself, and making things a bit more succinct. For his assessments, he should try to ""cut to the chase"" a bit quicker and say what he thinks is most likely going on (and why), followed by a discussion of other items in the differential.  For one of our patients with OSA, renal failure, and volume overload, he spent quite a bit of time discussing hypercapneic respiratory failure (good) but way too much time discussing Guillain barre syndrome when this was really not applicable.  
Communication skills: excellent rapport with patients and their families.  
Professionalism: outstanding- eager to improve and receive feedback
Team work: outstanding.
Teaching:  his presentations were well-researched and he made very nice handouts. 

Fund of knowledge: I spent a great deal of time with Dudley on call. He was intellectually very curious and enjoyed and mastered the topic of hyponatremia with me.  He had a great fund of knowledge and was very comfortable with pathophysiology.
Patient care skills: I also observed Dudley perform a history and physical, and he did a great job, though required prompting from his residents.
Presentations: Dudley learned to become less detailed and more clear with his presentations. He worked with Dr. Morris to improve his style of presentation and it did improve during our 2 weeks together.
Communication skills: Dudley demonstrated excellent skill communicating with our patients, the team, consult services, and the multidisciplinary staff
Professionalism: Dudley demonstrated excellent professionalism, it was a pleasure to work with him, and patients and housestaff responded positively as well.
Team work: Dudley was an excellent team player, he worked well with Delia and they each took turns teaching each other physical exam findings.
Teaching: Dudley was able to effectively teach about the biologic aspects of acute tubular necrosis recovery, a very scientific article, and be excited about it, with our group. 

I thought Dudley was excellent. He can work on honing His presentation skills as he move forward. Dudley read up on aspects of the care of his patients that were of interest to the team and he related well to his patients.


I think he did an outstanding job on this rotation. His fund of knowledge is appropriate for his level of training. He however, he has an incredibly keen curiosity and motivation for mastery of his skills (including knowledge).  He really applied himself and worked hard during this rotation to learn about oncology and as a result I think his knowledge improved greatly throughout the rotation. His biggest strength is in regards to patient care, his H&Ps are diligent and well thought through, and he has excellent rapport with patients and their families.  He was able to present medical information in a clear manner both to the team, but most importantly to patients and their loved ones. He has a great attitude and I loved having him as part of the team. ","Dursley, Dudley",Dudley,Dursley,2,3/31/17,2017,2,0,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

Very thoughtful, outstanding medical student.  Her presentations were at an intern level.  She attended to details, was always eager to learn, and really came into her own during this rotation.  She was professional, engaged in her patients' care, and was always asking us interesting questions on rounds.  She showed real enthusiasm for the pathophysiology of disease, and was forward-thinking in her notes.  I think her exam skills leave something to be desired, but this is expected for where she is in her training.  I was particularly struck by the level of emotional maturity and depth of feeling she had for her patients.  Overall, I would give her the highest possible grade nomination, she was certainly above the level of her peers and I am confident that whatever path she chooses she will make a truly fine physician.  It was a real pleasure to work with her.  As always...read more! 

Pansy was very bright and knowledgeable, and I was especially impressed by her presentation abilities, which were easily the best of any MCY student I've seen so far. She was collected, concise, confident, and clearly read about what was important to share with the team. She was also wise beyond her level of training in her ability to read by herself, see the patient, collect her thoughts, and then independently come to the team with her ideas.
I think in terms of areas for improvement, she should learn to trust herself in coming up with a plan. I know it's very difficult, and it's difficult as an intern still! But she is smart enough to come up with A plan that makes sense and that matters more than the exact right answer. Otherwise I think it would be prudent to be more proactive in helping with consults, etc (my fault for not encouraging this) but I think as a sub-I taking ownership of the patients and learning from consult calling, outside collateral, etc. will be key. Overall she did a great job and we're lucky to have had her on the team. 

I worked with Pansy on the cardiology service for about 2 weeks. She was very self-motivated and bright, requiring minimal direction from me to develop comprehensive assessments and plans for her patients. She was always willing to help the team accomplish the tasks of the day. During the rotation she worked to refine her cardiac physical exam skills and made steady progress. She gave an illuminating presentation on sarcoidosis, focusing on cardiac manifestations. I wish her success in whatever career path she chooses. 

Pansy Parkinson:
Fund of knowledge: Pansy asks intelligent and insightful questions, and does this for even the patients she is not following, clearly demonstrating her attention to detail and curiosity and motivation to learn as much as possible.
Patient care skills: Pansy is focused and very diligent when it comes to interviewing her patients and performing a thorough and exhaustive history and physical. Although she performs a comprehensive interview and exam, she is able to synthesize the most relevant details and pieces of information to present it in the best way.
Presentations: Pansy has FANTASTIC presentation skills - including her ability to put together a cohesive yet succinct presentation, and then in her actual delivery of the patient presentation. She is able to distill very complicated patients and hospital courses into clear and concise histories, and presents this all from memory and in a very engaging way on rounds. It is clear that she spends a substantial amount of time reviewing records and really getting to know her patients and their histories in order to deliver such thoughtful presentations.
Communication skills: Pansy is excellent when it comes to communication - she spends a significant amount of time with her patients and is dedicated to their knowledge of the plan of care and management, and also communicates effectively with the team and various consult services.

Professionalism: Pansy asks for frequent feedback and incorporates it immediately into her future performance. She also does a good job of asking for specific points of feedback, which demonstrates the insight she has into what she would like to improve upon and allows her to better incorporate it into future presentations.
Team work: Pansy was an integral part of the team! She identified things she could help with, and was proactive with getting these things done. No matter what kind of task it was that needed to be done, she was always positive and incredibly helpful, even when it was for patients she was not directly following.
Teaching: Whether it was a specific topic she was asked to present on, or was simply something she came across in her patient write-ups/presentations that she wanted to learn more about, Pansy did a great job teaching the entire team on rounds, from her fellow students to the interns and residents. 

Pansy was an excellent addition to our team. She was enthusiastic about picking up new patients and learning from their cases. She created great therapeutic relationships with patients. She helped with tasks that needed to be done for her patients everyday, showing her commitment to the team. Her fund of knowledge was strong.


ATTENDINGS

Fund of knowledge: excellent.  
Patient care skills: excellent 
Presentations: The presentations were organized and coherent. Excellent overall. 
Communication skills: excellent.
Professionalism: excellent
Team work: was an integral part of the team. 
Teaching: contributed to discussions about cases in the team.  

I worked primarily with Pansy during her two weeks on service with us. Overall, her presentations were sharp and polished. She presented many complex patients without difficulty and incorporated feedback quickly. She asked appropriate questions throughout and remained interested in the entire service, not just the patients she was following. She has a strong fund of knowledge and answered difficult questions I thought more appropriate for the intern or resident. She was great to work with and I think will make an excellent resident. 

Pansy was at the end of her medicine rotation and it showed through her very organized presentations with clear emphasis on the presenting problem. She had very good differential diagnoses. She gave good short talk on the suggested topics. Her physical exam skills although appropriate for her stage, definitely improved during the rotation. Pansy was very professional and fit well into the team dynamic with very well defined roles. 

Pansy: good fund of knowledge. Good history and physical and oral presentations from memory. Communicated well with team and patients. Very professional and appropriately dressed. Gladly presented a difficult topic for us that was well delivered.
Nathan: also good fund of knowledge. Very eager. Also very good history and physical and oral presentations from memory. Communicated well with the team and patients. Also very professional and appropriately dressed. Delivered an excellent journal review to the team.

Cho was very eager to participate in team activities and wanted to have an active hand in her patient's care. She had a good fund of knowledge and communicated clearly. I enjoyed having Cho on our team and it was clear that she is a true team player.  

Cho worked well with the team and was effective at completing tasks when given detailed instructions on how to perform those tasks. Compared to her peers, her fund of knowledge is lacking and her time management skills can be improved. For example, Cho had a presentation for her preceptor class the day after long call. She worked on both her powerpoint presentation and her new admission on the same day, and her bedside presentation suffered the following day because of her lack of sleep. We had a feedback session about this, and I recommended she create a plan for balancing her various tasks. I also suggested she study more general medicine (such as learning how to read CXRs, EKGs, etc). Despite this, Cho showed great interest in her patients - when one of her patients had a UTI that speciated into a bacteria everyone was unfamiliar with, Cho found an article and emailed the group with a summary of the information! 

Fund of knowledge: in the process of developing. Represents very early stage in clinical exposure
Patient care skills: history and physical exam skills, reporting skills, ability to synthesize information - limited; could improve upon thoroughness / obtaining and organizing relevant details of H&P and progress notes / flow of presentation, and formulating assessments that are both academic and clinical (ie, how is the patient doing now?). Overall, however, enthusiastic and eager to learn.  
Communication skills: very helpful and eager to communicate with patients / families, or gain collateral information from outside facilities
Professionalism: frequently seeks feedback, and strives to incorporate feedback; eager to improve
Team work: effective at helping to complete assigned roles; takes initiative in talking to families / patients
Suggestions to Cho: continue reading / expanding fund of knowledge, ask questions, practice presentations, practice history-taking and chart-review. Most importantly, remember medicine is an iterative process, and good doctoring will come with time and experience.  

I had the pleasure of working with Cho on the lymphoma service for one week. Cho is compassionate, dedicated to her patients, and consistently demonstrates curiosity and initiative regarding her patients' disease processes and management. She was a valuable member of the team and I believe she will be an excellent clinician. 

Cho was a wonderful med student to have around. She was always energetic, loved spending time with her patients, and did reading on all of her patient's medical issues, often informing us with latest data on rounds. She clearly loves what she does and is going to be a wonderful intern! 

ATTENDINGS

Cho Chang
I worked with Cho during her Gen Med rotation as her primary attending. Cho was taking care of two to three patients with direct supervision of her residents. She presented her patients on daily basis during morning rounds. She also gave the team a brief presentation about disturbances of potassium homeostasis on her initiative. She is a soft spoken and polite student. Her manner towards other team members and patients were excellent. Her patient presentations during morning rounds were excellent. They were very thorough, well prepared and well presented. Her skill to share knowledge with the team was excellent. Her presentation about potassium homeostasis was very well prepared and was of high quality. Also, she asked many interesting and pertinent questions during daily rounds which stimulated academic discussions. Her medical knowledge was good for a medical student in her stage.
Overall, I believe that Cho is an excellent medical student with sound fund of medical knowledge. Her presentations were very well prepared. She is very eager to learn more. She made a significant contribution to academic discussions during morning rounds, and she was considered as a valuable member of the team. I have no doubt that she will be an excellent doctor in near future. 

Cho Chang- 
Her fund of knowledge - very good to excellent
Presentations  - Cho was nervous during her presentations and this compromised the quality and clarity of her case presentations.  They were very good. 
I did not have an opportunity to see her interact with patients except in short exchanges.  Nor did I get a chance to see her work with her intern and resident.  

Cho did a great job. She was very hard working and incredibly helpful to her team. She was an eager participant on rounds.  She was a good communicator and delivered very good presentations. She gave a number of short topic presentations which were very informative for our team and helpful in better understanding our patients' care.  She was professional and respectful.  She seemed to connect very well with her patients. She was very diligent and comprehensive in her history taking and exams.  

Fund of knowledge: Cho is well read, and knows Internal Medicine well. She was motivated to learn more about cancer biology and treatment. 
Patient care skills: Cho was passionate about patient care, and established very good rapport with her patients. 
Presentations: Cho presented well, accurate and cohesively. She improved on summarizing the important and actionable issues. 
Communication skills: Communicated very well and effectively.
Professionalism: Hardworking. Willing to improve on advise. Good at self-learning. 
Team work: Well liked and respected. Very helpful.
Teaching: Good and effective. Taught us the MYD88 and BCR pathways.

I worked closely with Hermione. She was motivated to do a good job. She sometimes needed reminded to fulfill tasks, but she picked up on this toward the end of the rotation and began taking on more initiative on getting tasks done independently. Her admission presentations were well constructed, especially as she has just started her clinical year. She was responsive to feedback and improved throughout the rotation. She had a great attitude, was gentle and supportive with her patients, who spoke very well of her. One patient specifically said to me ""I like that Hermione medical student she's so nice to me"". She always tried to be helpful and it was a pleasure working with her. 

Hermione performed detailed histories and physicals, with well-organized and thorough presentations. She clearly thought about her patients, and looked to the primary literature to understand treatment decisions made by the team, such as the unusual use of G-CSF as treatment of febrile neutropenia in her patient. She cared about her patients and checked in on them throughout the day. In particular, she was supportive to a patient with a new diagnosis of metastatic cancer and her family. Hermione will make a wonderful resident and doctor in the future, and I hope she considers medicine! 

Hermione was an absolute pleasure to work with and the best medical student I have worked with so far at Columbia. Her fund of knowledge is excellent and she was very helpful to the team. 

Hermione was the best medical student I have worked with this year - hands down. She knew every patient on our list and was critical in assisting with the care of not only her own admissions, but with all ten of our patients - handling complex consults, taking exquisitely detailed histories and finding clinically relevant physical exam details during preceptor sessions. She is kind, warm, actively contributed to the learning environment for other medical students, house staff and attendings on our sister team and our team, and made coming to work a total pleasure. She will be a wonderful physician and I can't wait to watch her continue to thrive as she progresses in her career. 

She was on my sister team and I did not work with her closely. I just have to say her presentations during rounds were extremely organized, very well-tuned, and overall outstanding.

ATTENDINGS

Fund of knowledge: Was eager to learn and curious regarding why certain studies were done.
Patient care skills: Was able to obtain and convey accurate information without any difficulty
Presentations: Needed little guidance in presentations. I guided her to be more succinct but that will come with experience and was improving during the short time with the team
Communication skills: Appeared to be very helpful to the team and was an integral manner 

Hermionea was excellent.  She made exceptional presentations of some difficult cases that were thorough, articulate with a well thought out plan.   Her communications skills are outstanding and she was always very professional.   She asked excellent questions.  She presented on the risks of chemotherapy in pregnancy.  It was very informative and complete.   The presentation results in a group discussion of the topic.  

Hermione also impressed me with the teaching she did on rounds, putting together two thorough presentations on scleroderma and the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis in inflammatory bowel disease. She was able to take the knowledge she had gained studying IBD and apply it to a different clinical situation - answering several questions accurately about that the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis following gastric bypass surgery. She also did an excellent job with her admission and follow up presentations on rounds, and clearly had a good grasp of the main clinical issues with her patients.  

Fund of knowledge: Very good fund of knowledge and demonstrated great interest in learning.  Asked important and relevant questions during rounds and was also self-directed to find clinical answers through literature searches. 
Patient care skills: Excellent history and physical exam skills. Aware of important exam and lab findings in her patients.  Understands importance and urgency of new clinical findings (ie unilateral leg swelling in bed-bound cancer patient).
Presentations: Very clear and accurate presentations from memory.  
Communication skills: Developed excellent rapport, not only with the patients she was following, but also with other patients on the team. Excellent communication skills. 
Professionalism: Very motivated and professional. Demonstrates empathy and compassion, very important on the oncology ward. Accepts and asks for feedback, which she integrates into her performance. 
Team work: Valuable member of the team.  Worked well with resident and Sub-I.
Teaching: Gave an excellent presentation on XRT and cardiotoxicity.  She was able to cover a complex and broad topic and present it in a succinct way.  She was able to incorporate an area of her interest (cardiology) into the oncology rotation.  Handout gave an excellent summary of findings and how to manage these patients.

Penelope was an excellent medical student. She went above and beyond furthering patient care, not just for her patients but for all patients on our team. She was a great advocate for her patients, ensuring that they got the care they deserved, and helped arrange complicated discharge planning to allow for safe and timely medical follow-up. We had one patient, for example, who was deaf and only minimally able to communicate (some reading lips in Spanish, some signing). She took the time to get in person Spanish interpreters and a sign interpreter to discuss our medical plan. While the patient was only able to understand a small amount, this additional effort at least gave her some ability to communicate, which had not been possible throughout her entire course. Penelope made efforts like this each day and it profoundly impacted the care of our patients. Her presentations were well though out and she clearly researched her patients conditions. She can continue to work on confidence with presenting, but she is beyond where she should be at this point in training. 

Penelope was an exceptional medical student.  Her intelligence and medical knowledge are far advanced compared to her level.  She is very hard working, very diligent, great team player, very helpful.  She was professional, had excellent presentation and communication skills, and very professional. I don't have much to recommend for her to improve at this time. 

Fund of knowledge: Penelope was quite knowledgeable about a very complex patient with advanced cardiopulmonary disease.
Patient care skills: Penelope went above and beyond in helping the team understand her patient's unique psychosocial challenges that was instrumental in providing patient centered care for a very challenging case.
Presentations: Unable to comment
Communication skills: Penelope's ability to communicate struck as someone beyond her training. I commented that I thought she was a resident and not a 3rd year medical student as she was quite knowledgeable and succinct but spot on with her communication.
Professionalism: No concerns. Great attitude. 

During our time together, I was very impressed by Penelope. I've worked with multiple students in starting their MCY in January, and accounting for experience gained as time passes, Penelope is easily the best with whom I have worked. Her knowledge base is beyond someone at her level of training, and her Intellectual curiosity is beyond that of someone who is looking to get test questions right. She owned her patients, and was incredibly invested in their care. We shared one patient on the service that, while we all knew she had a terminal illness, it initially seemed as though she would be able to have at least a few more rounds of treatment and go home and enjoy something on the order of 6 months with her family. During our two weeks, she went from walking around her room, to being unable to interact with her family members. With compassion, professionalism, and dedication, Penelope helped me navigate the family dynamics of 9 siblings and 4 adult children, ultimately transitioning the patient's goals of care first to DNR/DNI, and a few days later to hospice. She was often in communication with multiple family members, and developed relationships that, as her resident, was amazing to bear witness too. This was the first time Penelope had dealt with a situation like this, as while we tackled the issues together, she consistently handled the tough conversations with poise and professionalism. 
In addition to her excellent bedside manner and ability to connect with patients and families, she was also Incredibly organized. She was always prepared for rounds, and always came up with thoughtful differentials for new admissions prior to our discussions. 
It was my pleasure to work with Penelope, and I hope we can work on a team again in the future! (I would love to have her as my Sub-I next year!) 

ATTENDINGS

Ms. Clearwater is excellent in all regards, has a superior fund of knowledge, was diligent, pro-active in researching patient's histories, and at the expected level in the exam and patient interaction. My only negative is that she likes to show-off her medical knowledge (which is sometimes not quite accurate); this improved as she gained more confidence in our interaction, but she should be couseled (gently) on this behavior. 

Feedback for Penelope Clearwater: 
I had the pleasure of observing Penelope present during morning rounds for 2 weeks. Even with some of the more challenging patients assigned on her on the service, Penelope did an excellent job summarizing complicated hospital courses and devising plans of care. She always integrated evidence based medicine into her plans and I felt some of her suggestions to the team actually changed plans of care which is rare to see from a medical student on the team. I could tell from some our discussions regarding her patients after rounds her fund of knowledge was above her peers. 

I was most impressed with Penelope's patient care and teamwork skills.  She was integrated into the team like an intern.  She knew the details not only about the specific patients she followed but all of the patients on the service.  Each morning, I observed her taking histories from patients, examining them and talking to their families.  Along these lines, her communication skills were outstanding. She truly communicated professionally with patients, their families, the team, her peers, nurses and consultants. Similarly, she excelled in professionalism and attitude. In these aspects, she was superior to most P&S students I have known at her level. 
Her fund of knowledge of seemed to be solid. Importantly, she was eager to look up things she didn't know.  

Unfortunately, I only got to see Penelope present one new admission.  She did it from memory (something I don't see that much anymore)!  I would rate that one presentation as very good to excellent; a few things could have been improved, such as putting critical parts of the history in the HPI instead of the PMH.

Penelope Clearwater
1.       Fund of knowledge: excellent
2.       Patient care skills: She asked me to teach how to do percussion better because she was impressed by my percussion- this is one of the nicest compliments that I have received in my medical career. I took both students to see a patient to teach them. They improved within minutes. Their percussion sounded like that of a professional. 
3.       Presentations: outstanding.
4.       Communication skills; outstanding
5.       Professionalism and attitudes. Always super enthusiastic. Went out of her way to learn more. Not shy about asking for help. 
6.       Team Work: outstanding.
7.       Teaching: was well prepared for her presentations ","Clearwater, Penelope",Penelope,Clearwater,,5/19/17,2017,3,0,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Neville Longbottom
Fund of knowledge: He has a good amount of medical knowledge compared to his peers in 3rd year medical school.  He had good clinical reasoning for his differential diagnoses. 
Patient care skills: Neville was well liked by patients and did an excellent job collecting relevant information.   In the future he should strive to take more ownership of the plan for his patients into 4th year and beyond. 
Presentations: His patient presentations were good, and will get better with increased medical knowledge.
Communication skills: He did a great job with communication and was always helpful and cheerful.
Team work: Neville is a great team player and it was a pleasure to work with him. 
Teaching: Neville made a couple great presentations which he gave to our team.  He did an outstanding job!


His curiosity was excellent, though I think he could and will build on his fund of knowledge as he moves forward. I would encourage him to continue reading on his own. His patient care skills are excellent, and he gathered history diligently. He worked well to report it and had good formulation. His presentations were accurate and clear, as well as succinct. He communicated well with everyone in the hospital. He was a great member of the team, and was happy to share all he had learned with us.  


Neville did a great job on the rotation. He's very personable, eager to learn, and asks great questions. He also cares a lot about his patients, which is a great attribute. Keep up the great work!

Neville Longbottom
Fund of knowledge: average
Patient care skills: n/a
Presentations: Rambling, and poorly organized, he stopped mid-HPI to ask questions about what was ultimately his assessment/plan.
Communication skills: unable to comment
Professionalism and attitude: He walked out of rounds one day while one of the night float presentations was happening, for no clear reason. He also didn't seem very engaged in hearing about other patients or cases.
Team work: unable to comment
Teaching: He gave a talk about endocarditis prophylaxis. I thought it was a little odd that he chose to focus on the European recommendations rather than the American ones. While it would have been appropriate to discuss pros/cons and how our recs differ from other professional societies ultimately we practice medicine in the US and I would have structured the talk differently.  

Neville Longbottom- very good presentations with some insights.  More interactive than many other students and participated in rounds. My overall impression is above average student. 
  
Neville was outstanding student. He was a team player. His presentation was clear.

Neville did a great job. He was engaged on rounds and exhibited curiosity and asked thoughtful questions. He delivered very well structured presentations that he clearly worked very hard on. He was a wonderful asset to his team and to his patients.  His patients spoke very highly of him and he seemed to connect well to them. He was always very professional and a pleasure to have on rounds. He additionally delivered several very informative topic presentations that were extremely helpful for our team.

I had the pleasure of working with Weasley Ginny (Ginny) for a week or so, please find my comments below: 
Ginny is a very caring, thoughtful and meticulous student.  She took great care and effort to piece together patients' histories, labs, imaging and other data to come up with comprehensive and detailed presentations and insightful assessments of her patients.  Throughout her rotation, she showed enthusiasm for acquiring medical knowledge and learning hands-on skills.  She was always very courteous and professional with both the patients she followed and the medical staff.   

Ginny Ginny:
1. Fund of knowledge - excellent, very eager to learn, good baseline fund of knowledge
2. Patient care skills - Ginny was great with her patients, excellent physical exams
3. Presentations - thorough, appropriately detailed, well organized
4. Communication skills - effective communicator, good public speaker
5. Professionalism - extremely professional always
6. Teamwork - great team player
7. Teaching - gave a great teaching presentation to our team on rounds.  

Ginny was an excellent medical student on our general medicine service. In particular, I was very impressed by her thorough, yet efficient, presentations on rounds. She also did an excellent job teaching the team about several disease processes in great detail. Most notably, she gave an outstanding presentation on the clinical features of scleroderma and created a wonderful handout that would be very helpful as a resource to many students and residents. Ginny also did a wonderful job of taking care of two particularly difficult patients - one of whom had a significant personality disorder preventing the team from appropriately providing necessary medical care. Ginny was able to easily communicate with her by displaying compassion and de-escalating the patient's frustration with the medical team, ultimately allowing us to ensure that she receives her medications, address many of her psychosocial concerns, and ensure close follow-up with her outpatient providers. Ginny is also very receptive to feedback, and provides excellent feedback in return. Would encourage her to keep reading and learning about internal medicine, as she has been doing! Certainly look forward to working with her again


Ms. Ginny is an exceptionally talented, personable and professional student with a remarkably gifted fund of knowledge and a natural skill for team work. From her very first day on the Cardiology wards, it was evident that she had not only prepared for the subject material that she would encounter, but that she was also eager to apply that knowledge to the clinical setting- expertly and efficiently executing patient interviews and physical exams, accurately interpreting her findings and appropriately suggesting evidence-based clinical management. Her admission notes and formal patient presentations on rounds were similarly impressive: she succinctly and thoroughly presented the patient's history of present illness with important, relevant and difficult to attain details, physical exam with pertinent positive and negative, disease-specific elements, and her own assessment with well-organized, thoughtful, and thorough differentials. During teaching sessions, it was clearly evident that Ms. Ginny had a broad and deep fund of knowledge that she expertly resourced in order to dissect complex clinical questions, yet she consistently did this with the utmost professionalism and humility. In addition to these gifted talents, Ms. Ginny is a natural team-worker: she is consistently cheerful, incredibly resourceful and ambitious, and always communicated expertly with all members of the staff. She took full ownership of her patients: she offered daily recommendations in management, remained aware of the details, including small but important changes in physical exam or lab trends, and fully prepared patients for discharge, including making follow up appointments and ensuring patient accessibility to medications. In conclusion, it was an absolute pleasure to work with Ms. Ginny and I have absolutely no doubt that she will make an incredibly gifted and caring physician and colleague. 


ATTENDINGS

Weasley did a very solid job with us. She presented very well and was quite organized and clearly spent a lot of time on her presentations; she seemed very well prepared; her fund of knowledge was above what you would expect at this time of the year; she was affable and professional and respectful and was an integral member of the team. I could certainly see her here as a medical resident should she choose that specialty; a job very well done. 

Weasley is smart and has a very good fund of knowledge.  She was on the other team, so I had less of a chance to evaluate her patient care skills, but I suspect they were very good.  She is hard working and an highly motivated learn and improve.
Her presentations were quite good and thorough.  After some feedback she was improved on her ability to present from memory.  Her interaction with house staff and attendings was very professional and she worked extremely well with her team.  She did give a wonderful presentation to the team on scleroderma, which one of her patients had.    

Unfortunately I only interacted with her for about two weeks, which is not quite enough time to make a thorough evaluation, but I suspect she has earned very positive reviews from everyone she has interacted with.
Finally, she was a bit reserved, which I suspect is the reason she was a little more quiet than the other student.  However, I never had the sense that this was because she was insecure about her fund of knowledge.  She answered questions with confidence.

Weasley Ginny was terrific.  She was smart, able to apply information, was caring, very interested in learning.  She had a very good fund of knowledge.  Was very likable, always pleasant.  Her presentations were very good, and she was able to formulate appropriate differential diagnosis, and begin to formulate a plan of care. .  
She was also well liked and respected by the intern and resident that we worked with.
Overall she was a pleasure to work with. ","Weasley, Ginny",Weasley,Ginny,,5/19/17,2017,3,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

He was highly inquisitive, enthusiastic, very organized and detail oriented with an excellent bed side manner.  He was a great team player and did a remarkable job on his inpatient rotations, even receiving a high five for his care from a patient.  His presentations were very organized and included the relevant information, demonstrating his understanding of pertinent positives and negatives of the case.  He was a ""pleasure to work with"" and a great asset to the team and always contributed in a meaningful way to his patient's care.  From the start, he showed a keen interest, passion, and enthusiasm about neurology which shined through. He consistently took the initiative to find out more detailed and higher-level information about pathophysiology and management of disease processes affecting his patients. He gave an excellent presentation on gliomas and even accompanied his patient to the OR to be involved in all aspects of his care.  He was remarkably empathic and established strong rapport with his patients, even continuing to follow them peripherally when they were transferred to other services.  He took excellent care of his patients and was always up to date on all of the details surrounding their case. This was evident in his daily presentations that were very detailed and organized, though succinct.  He took pride in all of his work, and he was willing to help on all levels of care.  He sought out feedback, and was very enthusiastic and motivated to continue learning and refining his clinical skills. His knowledge of neurological disease processes is more advanced than his peers and more than what was expected for a second year medical student. He eagerly absorbed any supplementary material and would bring in current literature to support his assessments on rounds.  He will be an excellent resident in the future (hopefully in Neurology!).","Dursley, Dudley",Dudley,Dursley,2,2/17/17,2017,1,0,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

He takes initiative, is exceptionally self- motivated, interested, enthusiastic and engaged.   His personality and enthusiasm shine through, and he dedicated his time to his patients.  He is sharp, lively, and appeared very interested in the nervous system.   While on the consult service, one patient wound up going to the stroke service and was not doing well and Seamus followed up on the patient and provided research papers regarding the reasons behind the patient's plan of care independently.  He is very curious and inquisitive, and consistently demonstrated great initiative throughout his time on the rotation.  He did a great presentation on the syndromes of the thalamus which was at the level of a resident.  He was always eager to pick up more patients, and he formed great relationships with them. He would even spend afternoons talking with patients who didn't have frequent visitors. He performed thorough history and physicals, and he gave well-organized presentations. He was also able to discuss localization accurately and able to make accurate assessments about patients. He was a motivated self-learner, and he did reading/research to share with the group.  He was a great help to the team, especially on the weekends.  Seamus is a polite, professional, and hard-working student who ranks at the top of his class. During the clerkship he followed his patients very closely, often checking in on them several times throughout the day and providing relevant updates.  He also gave a presentation on Meniere's disease where he went above and beyond by discussing the latest evidence on treatment trials. His write-ups were very well written and demonstrated an advance knowledge of clinical reasoning and neurological localization, and he effectively used the literature to support his discussions.   He is extremely intellectually curious and a great personality to have around on the wards, inspiring his co-students and the residents to have fun with their work and we hope he considers neurology!","Finnigan, Seamus",Seamus,Finnigan,,8/11/17,2017,5,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

He was always very professional, had great bedside manner, took a keen interest in learning about his patients, and delivered well organized presentations. Everyone enjoyed working with him, and he was very integrated in the team and took initiative with the patient's care by getting much-needed records and researching patient conditions. While on the stroke consult service, he was always on time, dependable and easy to engage. He accompanied a senior resident to several stroke codes and was more involved than any other student she had worked with and commented on how she could not have made it through seven stroke codes without his help. He caught on very quickly to how stroke codes were run and was extremely helpful. He gathered accurate information and correctly prioritized the next steps to take during a neurological emergency. He was trustworthy and definitely performing at a level above a 3rd year medical student.  Vincent was described as a terrific individual to have on the service. He was assigned several patients with extremely complex histories who required numerous hours of investigative work involving tracking down prior physicians and acquiring old records. He worked on this dutifully every day and was able to bring the team a lot of extremely useful information.  He is also very mature and professional which allows him to integrate easily into the milieu very well. He asks insightful questions which speak to his knowledge base and it is clear that he is actively engaged in learning material. He gave a short talk on spinal cord syndromes which was well received and informative.  He was an incredibly hard working student, took ownership of his patients, and was respectful and collegial towards his patients and the rest of the team. He is incredibly bright, with a strong foundation in knowledge.  His presentations were succinct, and honed in on the important data for his patients.

She is exceptionally good at communicating with patients, and she is able to elicit a robust history because patients are comfortable with her and she elicits things others cannot.  She has a sense of what details not to miss and what diagnoses to consider.   Her notes and presentations were stellar.  She asked intelligent questions and her knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurology pathophysiology was at the late PY2/3 level.  She went to the literature and looked up information her patients without being prompted.  She often supplemented what the residents said from her own histories.   She took care of very complex patients and did a wonderful job summarizing her patient issues---she was challenged by her patients, though after a day or two of caring for them, did great work putting all the issues together. She worked incredibly hard gathering supportive evidence and helping with the team's daily activities. She took care of a patient with a complicated medical course involving multiple organ dysfunction and was reliable in informing the team of any new events or concerns.  She was enthusiastic about attending family meetings and learning more about goals of care discussions.  She was professional and compassionate with patients, and she had an excellent fund of knowledge. Even early in the rotation she was able to perform a full neurologic exam and was able to modify the exam to fit the needs of the chief complaint. She was also able to identify important abnormalities on exam and provide a good assessment. She was extremely helpful and was very proactive about finding ways to help the team.  Her questions demonstrated that she was critically thinking about her patients. She was able to recognize stroke syndromes and stroke risk factors while on the stroke consult service.  She was a pleasure to work with, was very professional and respectful. She was enthusiastic about the rotation and was always asking how she could be involved or help with patient care.   Many commented on her excellent bedside manner- one resident commented that upon seeing several neurological emergencies together, she was very helpful in calming patients down and making them feel safe.  She is quickly able to gain a patients trust, and this is a unique quality that cannot be taught and she will do very well in the future because of it. She also asked very relevant and in depth questions showing her clear understanding of basic concepts and the ability to build further on them.  Patil took a keen interest in learning about every patient, whether it was in the ED, ICU, or floor. She was always enthusiastic, had a positive attitude, and would take the time to read up on her patients. Towards the end of the consult block, the residents felt very comfortable having Patil see consults on her own before re-examining the patient together. Her assessment and plans were very thorough and impressive for a medical student.","Parvati, Patil",Patil,Parvati,,9/22/17,2017,6,0.6,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

One afternoon while on the stroke service, he helped resident out with six sequential stroke activations and was immensely helpful.  He always showed so much enthusiasm that it made everyone feel better even in times of deep stress. He was proactive and picks up on clues very quickly both from patients and from the team and is a great team player.  He puts patients at ease right away.  He would come up with ways to help immediately, got patient's home meds, reassured families, helped protocol imaging, transported patients, got more information on patients' baseline exams, you name it.  He was running in every direction always on top of everything with great initiative.  He fully understands how the system works.  Personally, he shows exceptional empathy and care.  He was noted to function as a neurology junior when on the stroke consult service.  He is inquisitive, and has a really deep fund of knowledge and knows how to dig into it for the information that matters for the patients on the team. For a patient (not his!) who came in with an intractable cough, it was Cedric who pointed out that he was on an ACE inhibitor -- this was missed by the junior resident, senior resident, and attending -- changing our management for the patient significantly. Cedric always volunteered to help out with patients who weren't his, and didn't just do a task, but used that as an opportunity to learn and teach about some aspect of neurology. His differentials are appropriately broad, and he knows how to prioritize. He has a calmness and maturity that surpass his level of training. Cedric was an extremely thoughtful and insightful student. He was always prepared to discuss patients, and always had very insightful ideas and contributed well to differential diagnosis discussions.  Cedric is a keen observer and impressively analyzed medical and socioethical considerations for some complex cases on the neurology service. He's confident, has a great bedside manner, and references the literature to support his assessments. He learned a lot of information pertaining to neurology quickly. He'll make an excellent resident and future physician.","Diggory, Cedric",Diggory,Cedric,2,11/10/17,2017,7,0.2,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

She was reliable, providing good follow-ups on her patients, and she worked well with the team.  She worked hard on this rotation and spent a lot of time with her patients, which showed on rounds and in discussion with me about the patients. She took the time to read on her own and asked excellent questions.  She is incredibly efficient and has a strong knowledge base in neurology.

Though Oliver demonstrated a good understanding of brain neuroanatomy, he could brush up on spinal and peripheral anatomy/syndromes and his performance on the shelf suggests overall fund of knowledge is an area in which to aspire to continued improvement.   He was encouraged to work on his history taking and presentation skills, which at times were noted to lack organization and despite being very thorough could be overly inclusive.  Presentations overall were noted to lack focus and depth, and often focused on irrelevant rather than key parts of the history.  His performance was average in terms of examination skills and he is encouraged to develop this.  He should strive to continue to learn about neuroanatomic localization, and develop increasingly sophisticated assessments.  His write-ups were very thorough, however would benefit from a greater discussion of localization and a broader differential diagnosis.  Supervising physicians noted that he asked ask a lot of questions, which by some was misinterpreted as over- confidence as he appears to challenge those around him and was thought to be seemingly competitive with his peers.  Several team members also commented that though he was very insightful in listening to others on rounds and asked challenging questions to his fellow students, he could often not answer questions when he was challenged in turn.  In future team learning, he is encouraged to be aware of his interpersonal interactions and be respectful of his peers, allowing them to demonstrate their knowledge as well.  He may still be learning what his role is as a medical student, and in this sense should aim to be more self-directed and independent in his problem-solving, as he was noted to require significantly more guidance and direction than his colleagues.","Wood, Oliver",Oliver,Wood,1,5/19/17,2017,3,0.6,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Dean was an outstanding student on the neurology rotation.   He has an excellent fund of knowledge and superb communication skills.  He was an exceptional student and a pleasure to have on the service.  He was enthusiastic and engaged, and followed up on his patients who all identified him as their doctor. He was self-sufficient and took control of his own learning, with great initiative and intellectual curiosity.  He asked excellent questions and had a genuine curiosity about neurology and about his patients.  He was always asking how he could help and what needed to be done. He played an active role in patient care and the team was able to trust him with tasks that often medical students cannot do without guidance (such as explaining medical information to patients, arranging for diagnostic studies and communicating with consultants). He was also very empathetic and intuitive to his patient's needs. He developed strong relationships with them and had a particularly difficult patient that he handled exceedingly well. One day this patient presented us with some research that he thought was related to his condition (it was felt by the team to be unrelated)-- Dean took the papers home and came back the next to go through all of the information with him. The patient was very grateful that his opinion was taken seriously and reacted very well when Dean explained (after discussing with the team) how this was not related to his condition. Everyone on the team expressed being very sad to see Dean go when his rotation was over.  He is passionate, very professional, asked great questions, reviewed literature for topics, and showed interest in learning.   He is very mature, organized, thoughtful, and actively sought out feedback throughout the rotation.  He is well on his way to becoming an outstanding physician and any residency program will be lucky to have him.","Thomas, Dean",Dean,Thomas,1,5/19/17,2017,3,,G,General,"Brown, David"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Oliver is a strong medical student, both in terms of hypothesis-driven H&P's as well as empathy and emotional support for patients. As a sub-I he handled a patient load at or above his level. He was always eager to pick up new patients, and on weekend call he helped care for other patients that were followed by residents during the week.  In one particular case, the team had to give an uninsured, undocumented woman with metastatic cancer the unfortunate news of her prognosis. Oliver, who has an interest in palliative care, was instrumental in that conversation and his interpersonal skills and ability to comfort during such a difficult conversation was beyond some attendings I've seen. He lingered at her bedside even after the team left to continue rounds. Oliver took ownership of his patients at a resident level and coordinated and involved their inpatient care with their outpatient doctors. Over the weekend, a senior neurology attending who was covering for only 2 days was so impressed with Oliver's skills that he made a point to tell us with hopes of recruiting him to our specialty. Oliver will make a thoughtful and brilliant physician.","Wood, Oliver",Oliver,Wood,1,4/30/18,2018,,0.6,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

He displayed all the characteristics that one loves to see in a trainee -- an eagerness to learn, empathy towards patients in difficult situations, and kindness towards patients, staff, and colleagues.  Cedric is thoughtful and intelligent, always taking advantage of any downtime to read, ask questions, and expand his knowledge.  He always behaved in a professional manner and I enjoyed having him in the office seeing patients.  Overall, an excellent rotation and we are certain he has made the correct choice of OB/GYN!!

We both thought that Luna is a truly wonderful student and want her to stay with us!

My specific comments: ""Luna ""Luna"" was a pleasure to teach and work with. She is earnest, proactive, intelligent and worked well with all members of our team. I really found her personally to be caring and sweet. Not only is she motivated to teach and share what she has learned with others, but she also seems to care about the attendings as well. At the end of long days, she just always demonstrated kindness and concern to me, which was refreshing. I tried to give her many opportunities to scan and do procedures and she was always very attentive to details. We spoke at length about her career plans and her projects (including ideas for modules/lectures for embryology) and I really admired her ability to come up with ideas, propose a plan and speak with the appropriate administrators in a timely fashion. When Luna has a plan, she is motivated to make it happen. Luna is strong clinically, she has great patient presentations and actively seeks feedback. She has been one of my favorite students that I have precepted and I know that she will do exceedingly well in any ob/gyn residency, hopefully she will want to stay!""

I felt that Pansy was a honest to goodness treasure. From the very beginning, she demonstrated all the attributes you could possibly want in a student and resident. She was polite, proactive, intelligent, charming and tireless. There was no task too small and she found something to learn from each patient we interacted with. I gave her many opportunities to scan and she really worked on her technique.

In a short time, I felt like I really had the chance to know her well and she is wonderful.

Vincent was a true superstar on our service.  Everyone who worked with him considered him to be an integral member of the team.  He was incredibly engaged and proactive in L&D, clinic and the OR.  Because of his interest in being a part of the team, he asked if he could do a week of night float with the L&D team and I said that I thought it was a great idea.  His night team were thrilled to have someone as engaging and excited about OB as Vincent on the team.  They wrote, ""Vincent was a spectacular sub intern on nights for the week we spent together. He understood and integrated himself into the flow of the labor floor in a way few medical students do. He was maximally helpful in all ways, with clinical duties seeing triage patients, helping with translation, filling out baby papers, anything possible that was helpful to the team. He was always thinking critically about his patient's problems and asked insightful questions about the management of complicated medical issues that showed he had a good understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. He was respectful and had good situational awareness. His OR skills were easily at the level of an intern several months into internship. He was able to fill the role of primary surgeon through most of a C section, a role he had never practiced with ease and grace. We hope we have swayed him to pursue obstetrics and gynecology!""

It is without a doubt that Vincent is a self-starter and has the ability to take anything we teach him to the next level.  At the end of the month, we allowed him to have his own room at the high risk clinic to see patients, which is normally a PGY-2 privilege.  Vincent will be an asset to ANY ObGyn residency and we would hope that he would stay with us in NY, though wish him well in any top-rated program!","Crabbe, Vincent",Vincent,Crabbe,,4/30/18,2018,,0.6,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

Mr Dean is an outstanding student, who performed remarkably during his first rotation of this major clinical year.  Staff uniformly remarked upon his skillful adaptation to the clinical learning environment, his apparent strong knowledge base, his enthusiasm and his strong clinical ""sense"".

 

Dean's exam skills are advanced beyond the level expected at this level of training.  He domonstrated a marked degree of comfort and facility in stablishing rapport and examining patients.  His history- taking and presentation skills are superior.  At this early stage of training, he is capable of formulating differential diagnoses ""on the fly"" and generating preliminary management plans

Perhaps most importantly- Deans enthusiasm warmly impressed all here who worked with him.  He consistently sought opportunities to participate in the care of patients, attempting to utilize and improve his medical Spanish skills, as needed.  He diligently followed the patients for whom he participated in care and graciously sought the feedback of his mentors.

 

It is our impression that Dean will be an outstanding physician.

Her baseline fund of knowledge was excellent and she added to it over the weeks. Her clinical skills are developing well and she was observed to obtain appropriately detailed histories and perform careful, well focused exams. Her clinical reasoning skills were at the level of an early manager. Of her patient presentations, one attending wrote ""[her] presentations on rounds were succinct and informative, and she proved herself by going above and beyond to learn about her patient's non-obstetrical issues and incorporate other services into the care of her patients"". A formal presentation to her preceptor on uterine anomalies was ""excellent"". Another presentation on B12 Deficiency was ""great"". Ginny was an active participant in group sessions and, while she was never one to call out answers loudly, she was always correct. Her interpersonal and communication skills are strong and evaluators complimented her ""warm demeanor"" with patients. Eager to learn, it was clear to all that she was reading independently. She also accepted feedback graciously and used it to improve her performance. In addition, she showed initiative, always worked ""diligently"", and completed patient tasks reliably. These traits made Ginny a valued and effective member of her various teams. Submitted work included a well-researched, comprehensive summary of PID for patients. In sum, Ginny did an outstanding job on the rotation.

Her baseline fund of knowledge is excellent and she added to it over the weeks. Her clinical skills are developing well and she was observed to obtain ""thorough"" histories and perform accurate exams. In addition, she demonstrated ""Good technical skills in OR"". Her note writing ""improved throughout the rotation"". Her clinical reasoning skills were at the level of a manager for many of the conditions she encountered. Submitted work included a well-researched, clearly written patient education pamphlet on Pelvic Organ Prolapse. Genuinely enthusiastic about learning, she made good use of medical literature and actively sought out feedback, using it to improve her performance. In addition, she showed great initiative and completed patient tasks reliably. These traits made her an effective, highly valued member of her various teams. 

Her preceptor wrote ""Luna was a very engaged and enthusiastic student in preceptor session. She chose a difficult topic for her preceptor presentation: TRAP sequence, and did an admirable job. I did not work with Luna in a clinical setting, but it was clear that she was a motivated participant with the team with which she was working"".

A resident with whom she worked on her Gyn Onc block wrote: ""Luna was a wonderful medical student on GYN ONC. She was a hard worker and went above and beyond on the floor to help with any tasks she could help with, frequently checking in with the team to see what else needed to be done. She took excellent histories in clinic and helped maintain an efficient flow. By the end of the rotation, she was able to deliver succinct oral presentations with minimal use of her notes."" 

On her consult day, the resident with whom she worked wrote: ""[she] was extremely efficient in seeing patients in the ER and was impressively ahead of her level in terms of formulating differentials and management plans. Her notes were also impressive especially for this early stage in the clinical year. She will be excellent in any field but should strongly consider ob/gyn!"" 

Luna also shone on the OB half, inspiring one attending to write: ""I worked with Luna on the labor floor for only one day, but I wish I could have worked with her more. She was enthusiastic, motivated and eager to learn. She was proactive about getting involved in deliveries and demonstrated a solid fund of knowledge. She was pleasant and professional in her demeanor and showed a strong interest in Ob/Gyn in the short time we worked together. I sincerely hope she will consider a second date with our specialty!"" 

Finally, the fellow with whom she spent her elective day wrote ""while our time was limited, she asked meaningful questions and demonstrated true interest in the field"".

Katie's interpersonal and communication skills are superb.

His baseline fund of knowledge was solid and he added to it over the weeks. His clinical skills are developing well and he was observed to obtain ""comprehensive"" patient histories and perform careful exams. In addition, the proctor of his observed H&P complimented his ""superb"" bedside manner. Seamus's clinical reasoning skills were at the level of an interpreter. His patient care presentations were ""succinct but conveyed all appropriate information""; and his presentation to his preceptor group was a ""phenomenal case presentation, thorough with differential diagnosis and explanations why each would apply or not"". 

Seamus's interpersonal and communication skills are areas of particular strength. One resident who worked with him on both halves of the rotation commented ""Excellent performance... He showed a lively interest and high level of engagement on the rotation. His presentation skills are strong - articulate, thorough, and able to form cogent plans. He was well prepared for the OR and studied patient's histories and general pelvic anatomy"". Another evaluator noted he had especially strong situational awareness. While ""willing to jump in and learn"", he was also ""respectful of team and patient dynamics (i.e. knows when to jump in and when to step back)"". His preceptor noted he was ""[extremely] empathetic to patients and their needs... should consider [Ob/Gyn] as a career path"".
Eager to learn, made use of medical literature and of feedback to improve performance. These traits him made an effective member of his various teams. 

Submitted work included a well-researched, clearly written patient education pamphlet on Gestational Diabetes.

She became a well respected member of our team and her work was well regarded by our residents, fellow and nurses. She will have a bright future in pediatrics. Superb job!

Excellent performance in the PICU sub-internship. Presentations were complete, well-organized and well beyond current level of training. Good clinical judgement and well thought out treatment plans.
Pleasure to teach.

Katie performed very well in the Pediatric ICU. I was the service attending at the beginning and the end of her rotation and she make remarkable growth over the one month period. Specifically, her patient presentations were at the level of mid-year pediatric intern, she was able to formulate excellent plans on her patient at the level of a resident and she was an active learner. She always knew everything about her patients and used literature to create excellent plans of care. She handled the stress of a busy PICU very well and worked well as a team member. I often forgot she was a Sub-I given her maturity, knowledge base and strong clinical performance. I know she will make an excellent pediatrician and hope she will consider pediatric critical care medicine in the future. Any residency would be extremely lucky to have her.

It was a pleasure working with Katie as a sub-I in the PICU. The PICU can be an intimidating place with complex patients but Katie stepped up to the plate taking on difficult patients and taking true ownership of their care at a resident level. Her presentations were on point and she was making plans for patients in an impressive manner. Nurses trusted her to be first call which is rare. She was also pleasant to work with and team player.","Bell, Katie",Katie,Bell,,6/30/18,2018,,0.4,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Ms. Ginny's write-up captured both the long standing history of symptoms and the acuteness of new headache symptoms for which she came to be seen in the walk-in clinic. I offered an article on pediatric headache for her to read and afterwards we had a lively discussion on the differential diagnosis of headache."" She brought articles to rounds and gave presentation during the rotation. Her write up of a child admitted with clinical pneumonia was succinct but complete in the H&P while the discussion captured all aspects of the respiratory complaint.  Exemplary write up.


Interpersonal/Communication skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: Ginny displayed good interpersonal skills and created relationships with families and the team. Although a quiet person she was able to connect with parents and patients of all ages to not only obtain necessary information via history and PE but also to relate pertinent information to patients in a clear and understandable way.

Patient Care: 
Penelope displayed excellent to outstanding ability in her patient care activities in all settings of this rotation.  She was deeply committed to providing comprehensive patient care and challenged herself to take ownership of her patients to the greatest extent possible.  ""Penelope truly impressed me daily. By the end of our two weeks on Cardiology, I felt her to be more of a colleague rather than a medical student in her first block of MCY. She is self-motivated and constantly found opportunities to learn and teach throughout the day. She did not waste much time and was proactive, whether she was with her patients or helping her fellow medical students review concepts/topics in pediatrics. She is assertive and has confident demeanor, and thus it was easy to trust her with tasks. Penelope went above and beyond to know every detail of her patient's history. Impressively, she was able to understand the big picture concepts very well and put together the often complicated history puzzles of our cardiology patients. Her fund of knowledge is excellent, which is a testament to her hard work. Lastly, Penelope always circled back to the patient and their family.""  ""Penelope is way beyond her level. Her history taking, presentation and overall clinical skills are those of a MSIV! She consistently took initiative in both patient care and learning. She would read extensively about her patients and their conditions and educate the team when appropriate.""  ""I was thoroughly impressed with Penelope's performance in this portion of her clerkship - even as she presented her very first case of MCY year, she was performing at a level I would expect of a sub-I, or perhaps an intern! I was able to precept Penelope personally for 3 or 4 patients, and her patient histories and physical examinations included a thorough level of detail that reflect her strong fund of knowledge (i.e., in a patient with headache, obtaining history of floaters, palpating sinuses, performing forward bend, etc.). Her presentations were superbly organized (again at a level far beyond where she is in her education), and even on day 1, she offered management plans that were supported by evidence that she cited. She demonstrates a commitment to being a superlative practitioner. Morever, after offering a management plan (for a patient with ankle sprain), she subsequently personally wheeled her patient to radiology when a tech was not available, demonstrating an ownership of patient care. Such gestures reflect her professionalism and adaptation of professional identity. Her fund of knowledge also shone through during small-group didactics, when she knew the answer to every - literally, every - question posed, and I could tell that she would try and hold back to give her colleagues a chance to answer.""  Notes were timely, presentations were consistently on-point, and Penelope was always able to efficiently finish her daily work.  

Knowledge for Practice: 
Penelope's fund of knowledge was judged to meet, and at times exceed expectations for her level of training. She was often able to apply her understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting. ""Penelope was an excellent addition to our pediatric cardiology service. She clearly has great interest in cardiology and congenital heart defects - and has experience and knowledge that greatly contributed to the team. With her experiences in adult cardiology, she introduced the team to software that reconstructed cardiac CT into a 3D model - greatly helping the residents and medical students visualize a complex cardiac defect. She has great enthusiasm and is always asking for more information and insightful questions. I'd encourage her to continue this excitement to learn - and keep her curiosity broad to make the most of her clerkship year."" She scored above the group average and below the national mean on the NBME shelf exam. 

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Penelope was committed to outside reading during the clerkship in an effort to build a broad base of pediatric knowledge and deepen her experiential learning.  She was eager and hungry for all learning opportunities.  ""Penelope knew her patients inside and out. She was able to connect with several patients and their families. She learned from her patients and ask many great questions.""  Her case write-up of an adolescent with complex cardiac disease status post transplant was subperb.  She demonstrated a sound approach to the diagnosis and management for this dangerous condition and made certain to have a carefully referenced write-up that discussed the differential and management of the patient.  She was an engaged and vocal member of her team-based learning group and she enriched both small-group and large-group discussions.

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: 
Penelope consistently created excellent rapport and therapeutic relationships with her patients and displayed superb interpersonal skills.  ""The mother of one of Penelope's patients, who herself was just diagnosed with a DVT, days before her daughter's emergent heart surgery. Penelope took time to help the mother of this patient, recognizing the importance of the health and wellbeing of the entire family. I found her to relate well with patients and dig deeper."" 

Professionalism and Personal Development: 
Penelope consistently placed her patients' needs before her own, while balancing her own need to learn in the clinical setting.  ""Penelope is very bright qand self confident and exudes this when seeing patients who seem to really trust her.""  She was on time and present for all clerkship activities.

Systems-based Practice: 
Penelope was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care.  ""The interns on the team specifically commented on how great Penelope was at identifying areas where she could be helpful - volunteering to make phone calls and even gathering more detailed history, finding out PMDs, pouring over outside record - which she had identified as a need on rounds and taken the initiative to do for the benefit of the team without being asked. She is very hardworking and will continue to do well as a med student and will make a very good resident.""

Penelope is a highly motivated individual who was dedicated to sharpening her pediatric clinical skill set and her ability to deliver comprehensive patient care.  Without fail she took ownership for her patients and made significant contributions to the healthcare team.  Her enthusiasm and self-direction were welcomed and appreciated by the health care team.  She is well on her way to becoming an outstanding clinician.

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"The following is a narrative assessment of how Cho Chang fulfilled the competencies required in this rotation.
 
Patient Care: 
Cho displayed excellent ability in her patient care activities in all settings of this rotation.  She was extremely committed to providing comprehensive patient care and challenged herself to take ownership of her patients to the greatest extent possible.  ""Cho did a great job with her first rotation. She developed confidence throughout and I would encourage her to continue to put herself in new positions to expand her skill set. She showed a strong ability to ""read the room"" which stood out and will serve her well throughout her career.""  ""It was a pleasure to work with Cho during her first clinical rotation. She did a wonderful job in getting to know her role as a medical student on the team and was very proactive in helping gain more history from the patients that she followed. Her presentations showed significant improvement as the three weeks progressed and demonstrated that she could be trusted in accomplishing various tasks for her patients.""  Notes were timely, presentations were consistently on-point, and Cho was always able to efficiently finish her daily work.  

Knowledge for Practice: 
Cho's fund of knowledge was judged to meet, and at times exceed expectations for her level of training. She was often able to apply her understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting. ""She scored below both the group average and the national mean on the NBME shelf exam. 

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Cho was committed to outside reading during the clerkship in an effort to build a broad base of pediatric knowledge and deepen her experiential learning.  She was eager and hungry for all learning opportunities.  ""Cho is adjusting to the clinical environment. She is eager and open-minded. She was responded well to direct feedback about using medical jargon and the following day her presentation was better. She later had an adolescent with chronic back pain, and advocated for her during rounds, which is unique for an early level medical student. She gave a presentation on hypernatremia and I recommended to her that she try to keep her wards presentations case-based in the future.""  ""Cho did a great job on her pediatrics rotation. She was thoroughly invested in her patients' health and well-being, including both physical and emotional/psychiatric aspects. Her presentation skills improved dramatically during the first two weeks of this (her first) rotation, and although there is still room for improvement (ie: editing to include only pertinent information), her presentations are at an appropriate level for her current training. She had a good fund of knowledge, but was also willing to admit the limits of her knowledge and showed interest in investigating topics without prompting, all of which will benefit her in the future.""  Her case write-up of a patient with rash, arthralgia and abdominal pain was of excellent quality.  She demonstrated a sound approach to the diagnosis and management for this condition and her discussion was nuanced and well-referenced.  She was an engaged member of her team-based learning group and she enriched both small-group and large-group discussions.

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: 
Cho consistently created excellent rapport and therapeutic relationships with her patients and displayed superb interpersonal skills.  ""Having Cho as a team member was great. She always came in with a smile on her face and motivated to learn. During her few weeks on inpatient pediatrics she really made great progress in her presentation skills and by the end consistently had succinct, clear and accurate patient presentations on rounds. She was also very helpful to us as interns and a great team player"" 

Professionalism and Personal Development: 
Cho consistently placed her patients' needs before her own, while balancing her own need to learn in the clinical setting.  ""Cho was an excellent student who was always extremely interested in her cases and enjoyed working with children and families.""  She was on time and present for all clerkship activities.

Systems-based Practice: 
Cho was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care.  ""Cho is bright, positive and eager to learn. She took initiative in seeing patients and presenting.""

Cho is a motivated individual who was dedicated to developing her pediatric clinical skill set and her ability to deliver comprehensive patient care.  She took ownership for her patients and made significant contributions to the healthcare team.  Her enthusiasm and self-direction were welcomed and appreciated by the health care team.  She is well on her way to becoming an outstanding clinician.

Patient care: Pansy displayed excellent ability in her patient care activities in all settings of this rotation.  She challenged herself to take ownership of her patients and successfully managed common pediatric problems with ease. One ER attending noted ""At times, one might have confused Pansy for a new intern. One of her very first patients was a young boy who presented with a second episode of a seizure like activity. Pansy was able to obtain a through history and complete physical exam. She developed a broad differential and followed all his lab results.""  

Knowledge for Practice: Pansy's fund of knowledge was judged to exceed expectations for her level of training. She clearly read throughout the rotation and applied her knowledge to clinical practice. She scored well above average on the NBME shelf and her TBL scores were excellent.

Practice-based learning: Pansy was committed to learning and improving in response to the clinical experiences she was having.  She required little direction. ""She has natural intellectual curiosity, which makes rounds interesting with active discussion."" ""Pansy was interested in presenting a variety of cases. She constantly participated in case discussion"" One of her clinic preceptor noted ""Pansy has a very logical approach to her oral presentations and a well organized thought process when doing her write-ups. I greatly enjoyed discussing cases with her including guidelines for myringotomy tubes and the evaluation of heart murmurs. During two sessions in Continuity Clinic Pansy asked very good questions and showed understanding of the elements of well child care & immunizations.""  This is demonstrative of her effort each day. She gave several presentations on head trauma, hematuria and the PECARN study""Óall were very well done and relevant. Her write up of an infant with conjunctivitis was complete in the history and physical exam sections. Her discussion of the need for neonatal eye prophylaxis was an interesting choice and included issues around the benefit and results of the practice.

Interpersonal and Communication skills/professional collaboration: Pansy possesses excellent interpersonal and communication skills.  Her professional, warm and kind manner was noted by everyone who worked with her. She was eager to learn and actively participate in patient care.  She easily assimilated into the ER, clinic and floor working well with fellow students and residents. One ER attending noted ""She displays great empathy for her patients and has strong communication skills. She was noted to stay back after the end of her shifts to obtain resolution for her patients.""

Professionalism and Personal Development: Pansy worked diligently on her patients' behalf.  She was engaged in all areas of the rotation, asked many questions and presented herself as a confident young physician. She was always present, ready to participate in patient care.
 
System based learning.  Pansy worked to understand and access the EMR. She worked within the sometimes difficult hospital system to provide the best care for her patients. .

Overall, Pansy excelled as a clerk in the pediatric rotation and was an important contributor to our team.  She was dedicated to patient care and worked diligently to learn a pediatric skill set. Pansy was able to function autonomously with ease and cheerfulness. She has genuine empathy, compassion and passion for patient care and learning that is evident in all interactions.  Pansy is that rare combination of intellectual excellence, empathy, kindness and passion for learning that will ensure her development into an exemplary physician.

Patient care: Seamus displayed very good to excellent ability in his patient care activities in all settings of this rotation. To the best of his ability he took ownership of his patients and performed as if he was their primary physician. Initially, Seamus was not as confident in his ability to work with children but with feedback and motivation he made steady progress throughout the rotation.  Preceptors saw that he was able to eventually take full ownership of inpatients. He is conscientious, diligent and interested in all aspects of pediatric care and worked hard to improve his H&P and presentations.   He was active in patient management and made contributions to the team with articles regarding treatment and management.

Professionalism and Personal Development: Seamus worked to improve himself throughout the rotation.  Initially Seamus was somewhat hesitant to take on patients but as the rotation evolved he became more confident. As noted by one of his outpatient attendings ""Seamus was pro-active to ask for feedback from me on his write-up. We spent time discussing ways for him to improve integrating pertinent positives and negatives from the history & physical exam in his discussion of how we went through the differential diagnosis and then arriving to the final diagnosis. Seamus was very open to accepting of constructive criticism."" He worked to improve his physical exam and presentation skills and was facile by the completion of the rotation.

Systems based practice: Seamus was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care.

Patient Care: 
Patil displayed excellent to outstanding ability in her patient care activities in all settings of this rotation.  She was deeply committed to providing comprehensive patient care and challenged herself to take ownership of her patients to the greatest extent possible.  ""Patil is an exemplary student and was a wonderful addition to the team. She always knew what was going on with her patients. She tailored her presentations to what was most appropriate for the environment/team (for example, if the presentation was in front of a family, she used language that they would understand). She read the literature about her patients and did a great job informing the team about the differential of possible immunodeficiency diagnoses in one of her patients. She really went above and beyond in terms of doing tasks for her patients. She obtained records from outside hospitals, stayed late to help with last minute discharges, and more! She really was an integral member of our team and her contribution was quite helpful. Patil is also a lovely person and we really enjoyed having her rotate with us.""  ""Patil was a pleasure to have on this rotation. She was friendly, engaged, and cared about her patients. Her presentations were comprehensive, yet succinct. Her plans were thorough and well thought out. She always knew her patients well and took the time to get to know their families. She was engaged and eager to learn. She gave a great presentation the last day of the rotation. I'm confident Patil will be a wonderful doctor and great asset to any team moving forward.""  Notes were timely, presentations were consistently on-point, and Patil was always able to efficiently finish her daily work.  

Knowledge for Practice: 
Patil's fund of knowledge was judged to meet, and at times exceed expectations for her level of training. She was often able to apply her understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting. ""Patil was dedicated and passionate about taking care of her patients. She helped to take care of an infant with many subspecialists consulting and with a complex social situation. On rounds, she remained organized and concise despite the many teams involved in her patient's care. It was clear to me that she knew her patients well and that she had a good sense of the big picture. She was enthusiastic about independently reading and learning about her patients - she gave the team an excellent presentation on various immune deficiencies that we suspected one of her patients might have had. Patil was never afraid to jump in and help the team, even with patients that she was not primarily following, especially with translating for families on rounds."" She scored below both the group average and the national mean on the NBME shelf exam. 

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Patil was committed to outside reading during the clerkship in an effort to build a broad base of pediatric knowledge and deepen her experiential learning.  She was eager and hungry for all learning opportunities.  ""Patil is a thoughtful, intelligent student and was a genuine pleasure with whom to work. She is hardworking and proactive and immediately felt like a member of the team. The rotation only gave us two weeks to work together due to the timing of the shelf exam but together we were able to identify an additional clinic day to give her a more complete Pediatric experience. Not many students, especially those without a voiced interest in Pediatrics, would choose to do an extra clinic day but Patil did so enthusiastically. She was great with the patients and families, highly professional, communicated well with me and with the team, was always on time and completed her work in a thorough yet efficient manner. I'd happily work with her again.""  Her case write-up of an infant who presented with gastroenteritis and neck and flank masses associated with MSSA bacteremia was strong.  She demonstrated a sound approach to the diagnosis and management for and went into detail regarding immunodeficiencies.  Would have liked to see more regarding the case resolution.  She was an engaged member of her team-based learning group and she enriched both small-group and large-group discussions.

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: 
Patil consistently created excellent rapport and therapeutic relationships with her patients and displayed superb interpersonal skills.  ""Patil was exceedingly warm, gracious and affable. She really enjoyed working with her patients and seemed to really enjoy pediatrics,"" 

Professionalism and Personal Development: 
Patil consistently placed her patients' needs before her own, while balancing her own need to learn in the clinical setting.  ""I absolutely loved working with Patil this month. She was incredibly professional at all times but also fun and upPatilt. She made sure to pick an interesting range of patients to follow and kept up with all of their care. I had the great experience of working with her on nights and she took care of important tasks as well as brought energy to the team. Her presentations were always thorough without being overly detailed. I hope to work with her again!""  She was on time and present for all clerkship activities.

Systems-based Practice: 
Patil was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care.  ""Patil was wonderful to work with. She was engaged and took great initiative to learn from the team and participate in patient care. She took her presentations seriously and reviewed them with the intern she was working with before rounds. This attention to detail made her presentations excellent and very well organized. She is kind and compassionate and integrated very well with the team. She volunteered to help whenever she could and this did not go unnoticed.""

Patil is a highly motivated individual who was dedicated to sharpening her pediatric clinical skill set and her ability to deliver comprehensive patient care.  Without fail she took ownership for her patients and made significant contributions to the healthcare team.  Her enthusiasm and self-direction were welcomed and appreciated by the health care team.  She is well on her way to becoming an outstanding clinician.

Patient Care: 
Vincent showed excellent to outstanding ability in his patient care activities in all settings of the rotation and he clearly developed a solid approach to pediatric care during this clerkship.  ""Andew was an exceptional student who was a real team player. Always interested in learning and ready to take on additional responsibilities for his own education and to help out the team. He knew his patients well and provided excellent care. His presentations were very organized, concise, and above expected for his level.""  ""Vincent was an outstanding addition to our team. He was eager to learn each day, and consistently up to date on his patients' clinical status. His presentations were accurate and succinct, and adaptable to many situations. He was quick to offer assistance to the team during rounds and in the afternoons. He incorporated feedback about his presentation style and overall performance well throughout the clerkship."" ""Vincent was mature, confident, had excellent history taking skills, and was able to form very complete differentials.""  ""Vincent was amazing in our pediatric cardiology rotation. His presentations were very thorough and he had a wonderful bedside manner. In addition, he always asked very thoughtful questions that helped the team as a whole, learn. He did everything that was asked of him and more. He took on new patients, presented them fully, and worked with the residents to make sure everything was done for the patient. He stayed late without asking and had a inspiring love for learning. It was great working with him and he will make an amazing doctor.""  Vincent was a reliable reporter and interpreter of patient information and challenged himself to take an even greater role in patient management.  Notes were thorough and timely and Vincent consistently and efficiently finished all daily tasks.  

Knowledge for Practice: 
Vincent's fund of knowledge was judged to meet and at times exceed expectations for his level of training and he was usually able to apply his understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting. He scored below both the group and national mean on the NBME shelf exam.

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Vincent was challenged to read throughout the rotation and build a broad base of pediatric knowledge.  ""Vincent was very interested in working up a differential diagnosis. He improved greatly in physical exam skills. Vincent was extremely engaging with patients and families and made them feel very comfortable. He asked lots of questions and was very inquisitive.""  ""It was a pleasure working with Vincent and watching his confidence and clinical skill set mature over the course of the three weeks that we worked together. Vincent initially was somewhat reserved and presented quietly on rounds. With practice, however, he became more comfortable presenting in front of the team and the patient's family. I appreciated that he always took the time to introduce (by name) the family members in attendance before starting his presentation, which acknowledged the family's presence and I think made them feel more comfortable contributing to the discussion about their child's plan of care. By the end of the rotation Vincent was able to present one of our more complex patients, and delivered a presentation that went through each issue in a systematic, organized manner. He offered up an excellent assessment for someone at his level of training and followed through with very reasonable plan that took into account each of the child's medical problems and how they interacted with one another.

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"The following is a narrative assessment of how Gregory Goyle fulfilled the competencies required in the Pediatrics rotation.

Patient Care: 
Gregory displayed outstanding ability in his patient care activities in all settings of this rotation. He was committed to his patients and their families and worked to take ownership of their care. His history taking was skillful and physical exams were attentive to patient comfort and carried out with increasing skill over the course of the rotation. His patient presentations were delivered at a level that far exceeded expectations. ""Gregory developed an easy rapport with the patients and families he helped care for. He also began to develop his teaching skills during his time with us. For example, he was able to provide effective asthma education to a patient and his family prior to discharge."" ""Gregory did an excellent job in helping to gather historical data from patients and families, and always was up-to-date on his patients' interval events and current status. He was responsible and caring, and checked back on his patients multiple times throughout the day. His presentations were very good, and he did make adjustments based on feedback."" ""I think Gregory is naturally a humanistic physician and moreover, he makes the effort to go above and beyond for his patients. In addition to his humanistic clinical skills, Gregory has impressive clinical reasoning and solid differentials. He integrated clinical information very well and had a strong grasp on the medical conditions of his patients. He clearly is very dedicated and hard working."" Gregory committed himself to providing compassionate care, was a fierce patient advocate and always up-to-date with their clinical status. Gregory was usually able to anticipate the needs of his patients and with the assistance and support of his team he made significant contributions to patient care. His notes were timely and complete and he was always able to efficiently finish his daily work. 

Knowledge for Practice: 
Gregory's fund of knowledge was judged to exceed expectations for his level of training. He was consistently able to apply his understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting. He scored above both the group mean and national average on the NBME shelf exam.  

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Gregory was committed to learning and improving in response to the clinical experiences he was having and was clearly reading about his patients at all opportunities. ""Gregory grew tremendously over the three weeks we spent together on the pediatrics inpatient service. During his first few days with us he was more reserved, and his patient presentations on rounds - which were quietly delivered and could be difficult to hear - reflected this. As he became more confident in himself the quality of his patient presentations matured accordingly. This culminated in an excellent presentation during the last week of the rotation of the sickest patient on our service that blew me away. Gregory was able to wade through the mire of data in the EMR and outside records and identify the two key issues for this patient, MRSA bacteremia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. His presentation was well-organized, including only the key details, and he offered a thoughtful assessment and plan for each issue. He further was able to help field the questions this parent posed throughout the presentation, drawing on his knowledge of pathophysiology to do so. I was impressed that he remained calm and unflustered and was able to return to his presentation smoothly each time."" His case write-up of this patient was exceptional. All elements of the write-up were characterized by thoroughness, lucidity and sound clinical reasoning. Gregory developed a comprehensive differential diagnosis that was appropriate to the patient's presentation and extensively referenced. He demonstrated a deep understanding for each etiologic entity he explored. He was prepared for team-based learning activities and consistently made contributions to small-group and large-group problem solving. His individual score on the TBL was higher than the average. 

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Development: 
Gregory created comfortable rapport and therapeutic relationships with his patients and their families. He displayed outstanding interpersonal and communication skills. ""Gregory performed extremely well on this rotation and was loved by his patients. I was extremely impressed with his professionalism when it came to patient care. He delivered presentations from memory and translated to family-centered language, performing at the level of an intern. He was very conscious of complex social issues and tuned into the emotions of the families. His presence was always very welcoming and he evoked empathy towards his patients.""

Professionalism and Personal Development: 
Gregory placed his patients' needs before his own. ""Gregory arrived on time and well-prepared for patient care activities. On patients we followed together I knew I could rely on him to be up to date on the patient's current status. It was a great pleasure working with Gregory."" He sought out feedback and used constructive elements to better his clinical performance. He was on time and present for all clerkship activities.

Systems based Practice: 
Gregory was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care. ""Gregory did particularly well getting a history and physical on a patient with an undiagnosed inflammatory disease. The residents and ID fellow & attending all read his H&P felt that it was very precise, and included all relevant travel and personal questions. Gregory was nice and thoughtful, and a pleasure to work with on our team. He would be a great pediatrician if he decided to pursue this career.""

Overall, Gregory consistently demonstrated a commitment to compassionate patient care. He was a vital member of his team and he made essential contributions to patient health and well-being. He eagerly built upon his solid clinical skill set and displayed outstanding interpersonal skills. He is functioning at a superior clinical level and he is well on his way to becoming a superb clinician.

He has all of the attributes one would want in their doctor.  He needs to work on organization of thoughts--as demonstrated by his very disjointed write up and some gaps in performance on tests.  Would recommend continued general reading not just patients seen.

Comments should refer to specific behaviors, reinforce/clarify your above ratings, and particularly address areas of strength and weakness. These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"The following is a narrative assessment for Dean Dean

Patient care: 
Dean displayed excellent ability in his patient care activities in all settings of the rotation.  Despite only the second rotation Dean worked to take ownership of patients and to actively participate in clinical care in all areas of the rotation.  He was enthusiastic and motivated. His senior resident described him as a ""great team player"".  He was active participating in the ED and clinic offering to see as many patients as possible. An ED attending commented that Dean ""is a great student, he is very motivated, very efficient, and very helpful, it was a pleasure working with him"". A ward attending commented that  ""Dean impressed me by the OUTSTANDING care he provided to a teenage girl with Sickle Cell.""


Knowledge for Practice: 
Dean's fund of knowledge was judged to meet and often exceed expectations for his level of training.  Dean clearly read in preparation for the rotation and came to pediatrics with a self-learned base.  Individual TBL scores improved but he did score slightly below the class and national average on the NBME shelf. 

Practice-based Learning: 
Dean read throughout the rotation and built a broad base of pediatric knowledge that he shared with the team throughout the rotation.  He presented ""an outstanding presentation to the Inpatient Team on the Diagnosis & Management of Sickle Cell VOC with well researched EBM articles."" ""He created a presentation on Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia because he came across a pediatrics test question on a topic he'd never heard of; the synopsis was suitable as a study guide for an intern."" He was engaged and interactive throughout the 6 weeks.  


Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: 
Dean has outstanding interpersonal and communication skills as he genuinely enjoyed children and this experience.  He has a professional yet accessible manner and was able to clearly communicate plans with parents. As his attending summarized ""I'd also like to highlight that in addition to his intellect/professionalism he showed an admirable humanism. A child in the PICU was getting panicky as specialists, house staff, and RN's & support staff started to pile up in the room. Seeing the child's anxiety, Dean alone, took it on himself to distract the child & took an anxious, whiny, whimpering 3yo boy & had the kid giggling, giving hi5's & completely relaxed. Admirably human!""

Professionalism and Personal Development: 

Dean has an outgoing positive attitude and professional demeanor.  He was always present and ready to help care for our patients at every turn.  He was receptive to feedback and incorporated into his development.  He used all his experiences to improve.

Systems based practice: 
Dean was able to work as an integral member of the health care team to promote the best in patient care.  He worked diligently in all areas of the rotation.

Dean is an energetic, passionate and motivated young clerk.  His compassion, humanism and good humor were welcomed by the children and their parents.  He displays an enthusiasm for patient care and for improving his own skills as a clinician.  He worked diligently to improve his fund of knowledge, pediatric physical exam and management.
He was and is an asset to any team he works with and he will be an excellent physician.
We encourage him to choose pediatrics.

""As discussed in mid-clerkship feedback, Lavender should try to be more proactive in both learning and patient care. MCY year can be difficult - it is often hard to find 'your role' on the team. However, we discussed specific ways to be more proactive (such as creating a list of necessary tasks for patients and going over it with the intern) and taking on more patients, and i would have liked to see even more of that.

Patient Care: 
Lavender displayed excellent ability in her patient care activities in all settings of this rotation.  She was deeply committed to providing comprehensive patient care and challenged herself to take ownership of her patients to the greatest extent possible.  ""Lavender always came to patient-centered rounds prepared, having seen her patients beforehand. She worked well with the residents who were also following her patients, and together they formulated a plan. Each presentation was clear and organized and took into account the family's level of medical sophistication. Her interactions with patients were sincere and reassuring. Although she started, as most students in her class did, with a basic knowledge of Pediatrics, she clearly gained from each patient experience by reading up on the patient's medical problem. By the end of the rotation I believe she felt comfortable with patients of varying ages and degrees of illness.""  ""Lavender was enthusiastic and had focused and concise presentations, which was great!"" ""Lavender did a good history and physical and presented the patient which she saw on her own very well. Interacted well with the patients and families. Asked appropriate questions""  ""Notes were timely, presentations were consistently on-point, and Lavender was always able to efficiently finish her daily work.  

Knowledge for Practice: 
Lavender's fund of knowledge was judged to meet, and at times exceed expectations for her level of training. She was often able to apply her understanding of pathophysiology to the clinical setting.

She scored at the group average and just below the national mean on the NBME shelf exam. 

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Lavender was committed to outside reading during the clerkship in an effort to build a broad base of pediatric knowledge and deepen her experiential learning.  She was eager for all learning opportunities.  ""Lavender showed improvement over the course of her clinical rotation. Her presentations became more concise and better organized. She was thoughtful about differential diagnoses for patients.""  Her case write-up of a patient with an allergic reaction was of solid quality.  She demonstrated a sound approach to the diagnosis and management for this condition and made certain to make the all-important distinction between etiological subtypes.  She was an engaged and vocal member of her team-based learning group and she enriched both small-group and large-group discussions.  Her individual average score was above the class average and her team score was at the group average.

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Collaboration: 
Lavender consistently created excellent rapport and therapeutic relationships with her patients and displayed strong interpersonal skills.  ""Lavender was very committed and conscientious and had good rapport with patients and their families; she was well read and asked appropriate questions."" 

Professionalism and Personal Development:

He was clearly very proficient in the reporter phase, and I felt that he was already advancing towards the next phase. He built great relationships with his patients and always found out more background information to supplement a patient's clinical picture, which was really helpful. For example, we shared a patient who was in the foster care system, and Dudley always made sure to contact the foster care agency daily to give them updates and obtain collateral information. He also always made it a priority to include teaching points and literature in his presentations to help the team learn as well. Amazing few weeks working with him!""

Her history taking was skillful and physical exams were attentive to patient comfort and carried out with increasing skill over the course of the rotation.  Her patient presentations were delivered at a level that far exceeded expectations.  ""Though we only worked together for one week, Katie was outstanding. She collected and shared data at a very high level, being sure to include only the most pertinent information. She gave clear and efficient oral presentations during rounds, and was able to make connections with patients and families. She was able to think through complex problems and offer possible solutions and management plans. She was supremely professional, and gave an excellent teaching presentation (mostly from memory) on a nuanced topic (coronary artery dilation in non-KD febrile patients) that I would expect from more senior residents. And she had a great attitude and approach to pediatrics.""  ""I had the distinct pleasure of working closely with Katie during her pediatrics clerkship. From day one she made it her mission to integrate herself into the team and make herself instrumental toward furthering patient care. What stood out in Katie's performance was the way she conducted herself during family centered rounds. It is rare to see a medical student who was able to appreciate the subtleties required to present accurate and relevant medical information, in a sensitive manner that is appropriate for both the patient's family as well as the medical team. Katie was able to accomplish this task better than any medical student I have ever worked with. I was also able to observe the way Katie gathered information from patients and performed medical exams. She was able to elicit all the required details with ease and was able to appreciate subtle findings on exam. Her notes on these patients were thorough and organized and clearly reflected accurate and appropriate clinical judgement.""  She committed herself to providing compassionate care, was a fierce patient advocate and always up-to-date with their clinical status. Katie was usually able to anticipate the needs of her patients and with the assistance and support of her team she made significant contributions to patient care.

""Katie offered thoughtful differential diagnoses on her patients, particularly one with a puzzling presentation of anasarca. She fit in well with the team and worked seamlessly alongside the residents."" She scored above the group mean and national average on the NBME shelf exam. 

Practice-based Learning and Improvement: 
Katie was committed to learning and improving in response to the clinical experiences she was having and was clearly reading about her patients at all opportunities.  ""Katie truly stood out during her rotation. No matter how busy, she was always enthusiastic to take care of her patients. On rounds, her presentations were clear and concise. She established great rapport with family members and always included them in her presentations. When she was able, she fearlessly jumped in and offered to help the team translate in Spanish and was able to calm down worried parents on rounds by bridging the language barrier."" ""Katie did an excellent job on a difficult inpatient rotation. She was attentive and eager to learn at every opportunity. Presented patients on rounds with poise, identified problems and addressed them. Responded to feedback where appropriate. Katie was a great asset to the team and will make an exceptional physician in the near future.""  Her case write-up of 14 month old admitted with anarsarca was exceptional.  All elements of the write-up were characterized by thoroughness, lucidity and sound clinical reasoning.  Katie developed a comprehensive differential diagnosis that was appropriate to the patient's presentation and extensively referenced.  She demonstrated a deep understanding for each etiologic entity she explored.  She was prepared for team-based learning activities and consistently made contributions to small-group and large-group problem solving.

Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Interprofessional Development: 
Katie created comfortable rapport and therapeutic relationships with her patients and their families.  She displayed outstanding interpersonal and communication skills.  ""I cannot speak highly enough of Katie. She was consistently a functioning and helpful member of our team on a busy inpatient service. Her history and physical exam skills are on par with residents. She identified areas of need for patient care and independently completed tasks to ensure better care for our patients (even if she was not following them herself). Her presentations were well thought out and clearly showed her thought process and decision making.""

Professionalism and Personal Development: 
Katie placed her patients' needs before her own.  ""Katie was consistently working for the best interest of her patients. She was interested in learning and asked relevant questions. She was open to feedback and always working to improve.""  She sought out feedback and used constructive elements to better her clinical performance.

She showed up on time and was very well prepared for rounds. She knew her patients well and went above and beyond to read about them and contribute novel questions and ideas to their management plans. Her presentations were well organized and eloquently delivered.""

Overall, Katie consistently demonstrated a commitment to compassionate patient care.  She was a vital member of her team and she made essential contributions to patient health and well-being.  She eagerly built upon her solid clinical skill set and displayed outstanding interpersonal skills.

The senior resident on her team described her as ""wonderful to work with. She was very professional in her communication with the team, timeliness and accuracy of her notes, and in communicating with the patients and their families. She is able to develop great rapport with her patients. We worked on obtaining a full and thorough history, which she is able to do well. Her presentations of her cases during rounds were clear and succinct. Pansy's knowledge of psychiatry significantly improved during the course of the rotation and she asked very relevant and thoughtful questions. She is very bright, inquisitive and eager to learn."" Pansy's team attending made the following comments: ""Pansy was a pleasure to have on the team. I was amazed that this was her first rotation of MCY, as she presented from day one at the level of a seasoned intern. Not only had Pansy organized and formulated her cases well, but she presented without notes extremely fluidly. Pansy was able to develop good therapeutic relationships with her patients, including one whose family was fundamentally opposed to the involvement of psychiatry. She prepared an extremely well organized review of psychiatric symptoms that can occur in the post stroke setting. Pansy was a true team player. Overall she did an outstanding job."" A preceptor who provided weekly group supervision for the 3 medical students assigned to the consultation-liaison service added that ""Pansy is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate and mature young woman. She is intuitive, verbal, related and very empathic with patients. Her write-ups were flawless from the beginning."" The faculty member responsible for overseeing the medical students on the service noted that this was a ""very strong performance from this student on her first clerkship of MCY."" Overall, Pansy is a bright and mature student who threw herself into every aspect of the rotation with enthusiasm and grew significantly in her knowledge and clinical skills. She has clearly made an easy transition to the new demands of the clinical setting. Pansy will make a superb physician in whatever field she chooses and I would encourage her to consider psychiatry as she would make a terrific psychiatrist.

Ron is also one of the most consistent and even-keeled medical students we have worked with. He is patient, kind and very thoughtful and considerate in the patient encounter; he also brings clinical acumen in such a way that he takes comprehensive and hypothesis-driven histories all the while being therapeutic with patients. One attending cited his wonderful interview with a patient who was anxious and disorganized in thought process. Ron was able to really let the patient tell her story, calm down and then add necessary structure to the interview. One attending commented on his ability to see numerous follow-up patients in a clinic within one afternoon and rapidly assimilate/filter large amounts of information, focus in on the task at hand, manage uncertainty and manage the patients who were sometimes difficult. He is always able to synthesize the history into a case formulation and cast a broad, on target differential diagnosis. He captures nuances, as he did in his write up discussing a patient's traits and coping style and dealing with it in a sophisticated manner. Never wasting a moment, Ron came to a clinic with no new patients and he created an annotated bibliography of sorts on cannabis reference materials for patients and staff. He is organized and a quick, critical thinker. We have been very impressed with Ron's performance.","Weasley, Ron",Ron,Weasley,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Brown, David"

She brought a high level of enthusiasm to all clinics, is outstanding in terms of her comfort with complex patients and challenging subject matters, and she brings a fierce determination to learn and do her job at a level beyond expectation. She is a student that never needs prompting to follow leads, call collateral and do as much as possible to manage patients. Attendings appreciate her very comprehensive history taking and ability to give an organized and thorough oral presentation of a patient. She is always careful to contextualize the history and note what information she was unable to obtain and come up with ideas for how to get it. She has an excellent knowledge base in psychiatry and picks up subtleties in the patient encounter. For example, she interviewed one adult male with a very complex history and presentation. He did not have a clear axis I disorder and she was able to discuss, among many things, his arrested psychosocial development and schizoidal traits. Fleur has also been able to identify and address issues of transference-countertransference in a self-aware and sophisticated fashion that is well beyond the level of expectation. This consistently happened with different Attendings, in different clinical settings and she also wrote about it in her reflections. For example, with a severely personality disordered male patient, Fleur was able to non-defensively accept the observation that she appeared less empathic in this particular encounter compared to her usual patient interactions. She thoughtfully assessed the situation and identified that she felt a resistance to connect with him for fear of being manipulated or victimized by him. This patient had a history of childhood sexual abuse and we later came to know he carries a sex offender status; his interpersonal interactions are dominated by victim-perpetrator dyads. Fleur was able to discuss all of this and thoughtfully consider the information in the diagnostic formulation. Given Fleur's skill set and traits, she will thrive as a house officer with increased responsibility for patients and her team of clinicians.","Delacour, Fleur",Fleur,Delacour,,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Brown, David"

His pleasant demeanor and compassion toward his patients made him a pleasure to work with. Neville's intellectual curiosity manifested each time he spoke to one of his patients or thought about a related clinical issue. He applied his psychiatric knowledge both when developing differential diagnoses for his patients as well as in team discussions regarding treatment plans. Neville combined his knowledge of Psychiatry together with his familiarity with his individual patients, when obtaining histories and mental status exams. He developed broad differential diagnoses and  participated in the process of treatment and disposition planning, using as his guides what he knew of the latest scientific recommendations and his patients' preferences, as well as his own clinical judgment. The plans which he helped create were on target, focused and safe. Neville's interpersonal and communication skills, particularly in regard to his work with patients, were a strength.  He formed strong therapeutic alliances with his patients, who trusted him with the thoughts and feelings which made them feel vulnerable, and which they were reluctant to share with anyone else.  He also communicated effectively with his patients' families, as well as with other members of the interdisciplinary treatment team.  His presentations in team rounds were detailed and thorough, as were his notes.  Neville's individual work with his patients made his appreciation of issues such as transference and counter-transference clear. Neville was professional, timely and responsible.  He was compassionate and concerned about his patients' welfare.  He was also sensitive to the needs of patients from a wide variety of backgrounds.

With respect to practice based learning and improvement  Neville was receptive to feedback and supervision, and incorporated this into his daily performance.  He participated in family meetings where, after researching the literature for the latest thoughts about treatment of different disorders, he participated in the psychoeducation of patients and families. In the area of personal and professional development, Neville was trustworthy and had a level of self-confidence appropriate for someone at his level of training.  When he could not answer a question posed by a patient or one of their family members, he always looked it up so that the next time he saw the person, he could provide the answer.  When an answer was not so easily found, he could tolerate the uncertainty, and worked to help the patient and/or their family member do the same. Finally, in the domain of interprofessional collaboration, Neville worked well with all the other members of the interdisciplinary treatment team.  He acknowledged their expertise and experience; he also turned to them with questions.  Staff felt that he was easy to work with. Neville worked with a number of severely ill patients.  He was a compassionate and dedicated student who worked closely with the other clinicians on the treatment team.  Although he was often quiet, when asked for his thoughts about what to do next for one of his patients, Neville typically had a well-conceived answer ready.  I believe that with further clinical experiences, Neville will feel more comfortable allowing his confidence to shine through, and that his patients and their families, as well as his colleagues, will continue to respond to it.""

Neville's outpatient supervisor added that he demonstrated ""fast learning of critical thinking."" An attending who worked with Neville in the Psychiatric Emergency Room noted that he appropriately completed the evaluation of a patient but left without communicating before the end of his shift, even though the attending was expecting him to see another patient.  Overall Neville is a bright student with excellent interpersonal skills who provided excellent care for his patients and grew significantly in his clinical knowledge and skills over the course of the rotation. With further attention to consistency Neville will make a fine physician in whatever field he chooses.","Longbottom, Neville",Neville,Longbottom,3,8/11/17,2017,5,0.4,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

She was able to work autonomously when appropriate, and readily sought supervision when unsure how to proceed.  Ginny also demonstrated exceptional clinical reasoning skills, and she was able to apply her knowledge well in the domains of diagnosis and treatment.  She proposed diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on her daily interviews with patients and demonstrated exemplary clinical judgment.  Ginny possessed an advanced knowledge of psychiatric disorders including severe psychotic, mood, and personality disorders.  She also exceeded expectations in the domain of clinical care.  Her interview skills, history-taking, and mental status exams were notably advanced and she was able to establish and maintain rapport with a variety of challenging patients.  Ginny also demonstrated excellent communication skills, effectively communicating with her patients and with all members of our multi-disciplinary treatment team.  She liased with consulting physicians from other medical specialties and communicated their recommendations to the treatment team.  Her written documentation was well-organized, comprehensive, and timely, and her oral presentations during team rounds were thoughtful and concise.  Ginny worked with several challenging patients during her rotation on our unit, including a woman with severe schizoaffective disorder, a man with psychotic depression, and a young woman with delusional disorder versus schizophrenia.  Through her careful and empathic interactions with these patients, she was able to skillfully establish and maintain therapeutic alliances despite their challenging presentations and paranoia toward health care professionals.  Ginny consistently demonstrated professionalism and was trustworthy, honest, reliable, and ethical, taking initiative and responsibility in completing tasks on behalf of her patients and the treatment team.  In terms of systems-based practice, Ginny was an integral member of the treatment team, making meaningful contributions to the diagnoses and care of her patients.  She demonstrated awareness of the issues and situations which impact the availability and quality of care, and made helpful suggestions to insure her patients received the best treatment possible.  She demonstrated strong awareness of the role of cultural differences in the diagnosis and treatment of a diverse patient population.  She incorporated feedback from both the attending and resident physicians into daily practice and demonstrated a level of confidence that put patients and staff at ease.  Ginny participated in the education of patients and colleagues, making use of the academic literature as it pertained to her patients' diagnoses and treatment plans.  Finally, Ginny was a well-liked member of the treatment team and genuinely a joy to work with.  She will clearly excel in residency, and will be especially suited to the field of psychiatry should she choose to pursue it as a specialty.""

The patients trusted her and told her things they did not share with other team members.

Dean's supervising attending on the NYS Psychiatric Institute inpatient unit to which he was assigned for the majority of his clinical psychiatry experience made the following comments: ""Dean's clinical reasoning was well above average, and he was able to apply his knowledge in the domains of diagnosis and treatment.  He proposed diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on his daily interviews with patients and outside reading, and demonstrated exemplary clinical judgment.  In patient care, Dean also exceeded expectations.  His interview skills, history-taking, and mental status exams were notably advanced and he was able to establish and maintain rapport with a variety of challenging patients.  Dean also demonstrated outstanding communication skills, effectively communicating with his patients and with all members of our multi-disciplinary treatment team.  He liaised with consulting physicians from other medical specialties and communicated their recommendations to the treatment team.  His written documentation was well-organized, comprehensive, and timely, and his oral presentations during team rounds were thoughtful and concise.  Dean worked with several challenging patients during his rotation on our unit, including and young man with schizoaffective disorder and antisocial traits and a woman with chronic schizoaffective disorder and severe substance use.  Through his careful, empathic, and organized interactions with these patients, he was able to skillfully establish and maintain therapeutic alliances despite their challenging presentations.  Dean's outstanding ability to communicate with patients and family members was noted by multiple treatment team members, including a social worker with 30+ years' experience after she observed him run a family meeting.  Dean consistently demonstrated professionalism and was trustworthy, honest, reliable, and ethical, taking initiative and responsibility in completing tasks on behalf of his patients and the treatment team.  In terms of systems-based practice, Dean was an integral member of the treatment team.  He demonstrated awareness of the issues and situations which impact the availability and quality of care, and made helpful suggestions to insure his patients received the best treatment possible.  He was able to work autonomously when appropriate, and readily sought supervision when unsure how to proceed.  He incorporated feedback from both the attending and resident physicians into daily practice and demonstrated a level of confidence that put patients and staff at ease.  Dean participated in the education of patients and colleagues, making use of the academic literature as it pertained to his patients' diagnoses and treatment plans.  Finally, Dean was a well-liked member of the treatment team and genuinely a joy to work with.  He will clearly excel in residency, and will be especially suited to the field of psychiatry should he choose to pursue it as a specialty.""  Dean's outpatient supervisor added that he was ""impressive as evidenced by his outstanding critical thinking, curiosity and openness to learn. His knowledge of Spanish will serve him well.""  Overall Dean is a bright and hard-working student who threw himself into every aspect of the rotation with enthusiasm and grew significantly in his clinical knowledge and skills.  Dean will make a fine physician in whatever field he chooses and I would encourage him to consider Psychiatry as he would make a terrific psychiatrist.","Thomas, Dean",Dean,Thomas,1,9/22/17,2017,6,,G,General,"Brown, David"

His written work, when given some time, demonstrated capacity to take a comprehensive history and present it in an organized fashion, summarize the information into nice case summary and cast a broad differential-- even considering a binge-eating disorder for one patient-- and his treatment planning was patient centered including thoughts about the importance of vocation.","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

Colin is endowed with the traits and skills of a great psychiatrist-- a keen observer of the intricacies of human behavior, a natural capacity for empathy, an impressive degree of self-awareness, and thinking on the meta-level comes easily and with joy. Although not formally graded, his patient reflection demonstrated these traits in spades. In reflecting on his experience in an addictions clinic, he mused about the ""centrality of the urine drug screen,"" how the ""bladder not the eyes"" are the window to the soul, and how this simple test impacts the clinician-patient relationship and acts as the ""bad cop"" of the treatment team. His patient write-ups have consistently been superior-- well organized filtered, flows well, descriptive and accurate MSEs, differential diagnosis always on target and his arguments solidly supported with knowledge of diagnostic criteria. His biopsychosocial formulations, whether on the spot, or with time in a write up, are very sophisticated and he always sees the big picture while not losing sight of the important details. As an interviewer, he functions like a psychiatry resident-- he is gentle, unassuming, and patient, but then also assertive enough to redirect patients and skilled with navigating sensitive topics such as trauma. Colin is also incredibly flexible and quick on his feet. One attending noted how the objective of a particular clinic changed and he ""didn't blink,"" successfully interviewing a cognitively and hearing impaired patient. Colin has also engaged in extra-curricular activities related to psychiatry, working on a research study investigating changes in depression on PHQ9 after back surgery. Colin will be a star no matter which field he chooses; we think he is particularly skilled in psychiatry and know he would be an outstanding house officer and psychiatrist.","Creevey, Colin",Colin,Creevey,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

 based learning and improvement, personal and professional development, and interprofessional
 collaboration). Comments should refer to specific behaviors, reinforce/clarify above ratings, and
 particularly address areas of strength and weakness.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Cedric' supervising attending on the NYS Psychiatric Institute inpatient unit to which he was assigned for the majority of his clinical psychiatry experience made the following comments:  ""Cedric' performance during his clerkship in Psychiatry was outstanding!  He performed at or above expectations in each of the competency domains, and in many of them he shone.  He was mature and interpersonally gifted, and worked effectively with our population of severely mentally ill patients.  He was thoughtful and eager to learn, applying what he learned in classes and on his own to his clinical work. He was also self-reflective, spending time thinking about how his own past experiences impacted his clinical work, as well as about how his clinical work impacted him personally.  He was a pleasure to supervise. 

Cedric arrived on the unit with a strong fund of knowledge in Psychiatry.  He demonstrated significant intellectual curiosity, reading diligently throughout the rotation, and using patient interviews as opportunities to re-evaluate patients' diagnoses.  Having done so, he applied his knowledge to think about issues of treatment and prognosis.

Cedric' patient care skills were impressive: he took careful histories and mental status exams, and followed up on statements or answers to questions which were unclear.  Based on what he learned from patient and family interviews, reading that he had either done on his own or for class, as well as his own excellent clinical judgment, he made significant contributions to team discussions about treatment and disposition plans.  Ultimately, Cedric was able to play a key role in prioritizing some next steps for his patients' care plans, as well as to participate in the process of explaining these steps to his patients and their families.

As the above suggests, Cedric' interpersonal and communication skills were particularly impressive.  One of his three patients was a relatively young person who appeared to have been paranoid for much of her life, and had been transferred from Milstein after having been admitted there with fronto-temporal dementia with associated hallucinations and paranoid and persecutory delusions.  This patient had minimal insight into any aspect of her ongoing psychotic symptoms, and was disinclined to believe anything the team had to say as she felt persecuted by the Neurology team at Milstein for having transferred her to PI when there was ""nothing wrong.""  Cedric was able to form an alliance with her, however, and was able to start an ongoing conversation about her difficulty with reality testing -- ""entertaining other possibilities.""  He was also able to bring up the topic of dementia and help us convince her to undergo neuropsychiatric testing -- which confirmed this diagnosis.  Cedric also participated in family meetings with this patient and her daughter, and tried to help them both imagine what it might look like to have this formerly independent and even help-rejecting woman move in with her adult daughter, who had recently been diagnosed with her own incurable neurological illness.  Cedric did an outstanding job helping these women, as well as helping his other patients and their families, navigate the often choppy waters in which the chronically mentally ill and their families find themselves.  He conveyed the content of these meetings to other members of the team both in his oral presentations in team and in his written notes, all of which made clear the extent to which he understood the priorities of his patients' care.  Working with such ill patients, Cedric was also very thoughtful about issues of transference and counter-transference, and how they can affect treatment.  He was honest and forthcoming about his thoughts and feelings about his patients, and discussed them in appropriate venues.  Having done so, he was able to use his understanding of his counter-transference and treansference relative to a particular patient more effectively when interacting with them.

Cedric was nothing but professional throughout the rotation.  He showed tremendous initiative and enthusiasm, going with a patient and her family to clinic so that he could watch her outpatient provider interview her and then he and the provider could discuss the findings in real time.  He accompanied another patient to a Neurology Conference, listening to the neurologists' impressions of her and then sharing our thoughts with the neurologists.  Such actions also give ample evidence of Cedric' ability to collaborate interprofessionally, as does his respect for the expertise of the other members of the interdisciplinary treatment team on 4 South. Cedric showed enormous compassion and respect for his patients, and even the most paranoid among them responded to his warm, empathic manner.  He followed through on whatever he was asked or volunteered to do, and was reliable and punctual.  Finally, working with a diverse patient population on a community psychiatry unit, Cedric' sensitivity to his patients' many and varied needs was clear, as was his willingness to work to try to meet these needs.

With respect to practice based learning and improvement, Cedric repeatedly took the initiative to learn as much as possible about the illnesses affecting his patients, about the systems affecting the care his patients received, and about some of the issues prevalent on an inpatient psychiatry unit -- doing his research presentation on the assessment and management of violence on inpatient psychiatric units, for example. He asked for feedback and integrated the feedback he received into his practice.  As noted earlier, he read the literature related to his patients' presentations, and used this information to help psychoeducate his patients and their families, using language that maximized the chances of their understanding.

With respect to personal and professional development, Cedric demonstrated a trustworthiness, sound clinical judgment and quiet self-confidence that allowed both housestaff and me to feel secure when he was responsible for our shared patients.  The same characteristics put his patients and their families at ease, as well, and enabled us all to discuss sometimes challenging clinical issues, such as a new diagnosis of dementia and how it might impact not only a patient's life, but a fragile family system, as well.  Cedric' maturity and prior life experiences allowed him to appreciate and manage much of the ambiguity inherent in caring for such ill patients, and to help him help his patients do the same.

With respect to interprofessional collaboration, Cedric excelled.  He was in frequent contact with his patients' outpatient providers, obtaining parallel history, providing them with clinical updates and generally maintaining an open line of communication.  He worked equally closely with the other members of the inpatient treatment team, respecting their expertise and learning from their experience.

In short, working with Cedric was a pleasure.  He was warm and compassionate, enthusiastic and hard-working.  He approaches his patients creatively, and is as able to consider the details of their care as he is the larger picture.  I encourage him to consider a career in Psychiatry.""

Cedric' outpatient supervisor added that he ""impressed me by his sophisticated thinking when discussing clinical cases. He also shows compassion, curiosity and thoughtfulness during patient interviews.""

Overall Cedric is a bright, mature, and hard-working student with superb interpersonal skills. He grew significantly in his clinical skills and knowledge over the course of the rotation and provided exemplary care for his patients. Cedric will make a wonderful physician in whatever field he chooses and I would urge him to consider psychiatry as he would make a terrific psychiatrist.","Diggory, Cedric",Diggory,Cedric,2,3/31/17,2017,2,0.2,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

At Creedmoor Mr. Malfoy's attending preceptor felt that he performed at an honors level.  In his work with the two patients with whom he met daily, he made great efforts to develop the details of history necessary for an in depth understanding of the patients and their struggles, all while employing a naturally empathic approach which allowed for the development of a solid therapeutic alliance in each case.  His case write-up was solid and comprehensive, and he showed an impressive ability to synthesize the historical, diagnostic and psychodynamic aspects of the case into a three-dimensional case formulation.  He was professional and collegial with patients and staff alike, and his efforts were greatly appreciated by both.  In supervision he participated actively and was thoughtful and open-minded at all times.  In sum it was a delight to work with Draco.
Mr. Malfoy's supervisor in the adult evaluation clinic considered his work to be at a high pass level: ""Draco overall performed excellently. He particularly possessed an excellent knowledge base, and obviously had read, and learned, material from his didactic psychiatric class. Further, he was gentle and caring in relating to the patient whom he interviewed, and worked hard to establish appropriate, empathetic rapport. Draco asked required questions for establishing, and 'fine-tuning,' a differential diagnosis, and very thoughtfully applied gathered data to considered diagnostic entities. Finally, Draco admirably sought to improve his interview skills, seeking supervisor's feedback after each patient session.""

Patil came from another clinical site during the second week of the clerkship period due to circumstances beyond her control. Despite this mid-clerkship change, she was able to excel -- showing voracious appetite for learning and outstanding motivation to maximize her clinical experience. At all times, she demonstrated in-depth preparation and thoughtful application of complex psychiatric concepts in the care of very sick patients with complex diagnostic co-morbidities. She quickly impressed the primary team with superbly organized and very well-reasoned analyses of the patients' biological and psychological diagnostic bases of illness. She proactively and enthusiastically volunteered to assist in the care of several patients and presented daily at the team meetings. Social workers, nursing staff and consulting teams appreciated her ongoing input, as she was a reliable source of information about the patients she followed. Most importantly, she was also able to communicate effectively with several patients who were severely ill. She volunteered several evidence-based presentations that were well researched and advanced the treatment of patients she cared for. Patil is pleasant, respectful and has a natural gift of being able to form a strong empathetic and therapeutic connection with the patients she works with, at times provided the necessary psychological support and at other times gently and successfully provided psycho-education that gently challenged some maladaptive coping strategies. She provided outstanding care throughout. Patil is superbly well organized and was able to impressively juggle complex schedule of a very busy clerkship in an exemplary way, at all times demonstrating deeply empathic insight into her patients' illness and readiness to work extra hard to provide the much appreciated relief. Very early on in the clerkship she demonstrated professionalism and reliability to follow the maximum number of patients allowed by the clerkship guidelines. Remarkably, she made a positive contribution to ease the suffering of all the patients she worked with. She consistently provided highly professional care and demonstrated sensitivity to diverse issues, all done with high degree of reliability and enthusiasm. Of note, and to underscore her high level of mastery in the clerkship, she was able to do all her work in an efficient manner with some time to spare that allowed her to participate in other cultural and student activities. Patients, nursing staff, as well as interdisciplinary health workers remarked often that it was a pleasure to work with Patil and appreciated her calm but impassioned, collected and knowledgeable approach that inspired confidence in both patients and her co-workers.""   Patil's outpatient supervisor added that ""It was a pleasure to work with Patil although brief.  She is inquisitive, thoughtful and motivated.  She will be a great asset to any field she chooses to pursue.""  Overall Patil is a bright and mature student who threw herself into every aspect of the rotation with enthusiasm and grew significantly in her clinical knowledge and skills.  Patil will make an excellent physician in whatever field she chooses and I would urge her to pursue her interest in psychiatry as she would make a terrific psychiatrist.","Parvati, Patil",Patil,Parvati,,11/3/17,2017,7,0.6,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

At Creedmoor, Mr. Crabbe's principal attending supervisor considered his work to be at an honors level: ""Vincent came across as a caring, compassionate clinician. He was a delight to work with. He wondered about and discussed ways in which treatment issues are dealt with for an acutely psychotic patient who was constantly pacing and talking to herself. This sensitivity and thoughtfulness towards other patients is wonderful; it reflects his maturity as a clinician. He was thoughtful, intuitive and flexible in his interviewing style. These characteristics helped him build rapport with the two patients assigned to him. He was fascinated by the level of dysfunction in his first patient, who is a college graduate, as opposed to his second patient, a high school graduate who seemed to relate better in the sessions. He sat in on family sessions of  his first patient and was able to identify the strained relationship between the patient and her mother. He was empathic towards  the patient's limitation in asserting herself, the conflict of wanting to please her mother versus herself and the limited insight of her mother posing a threat to patient's compliance with treatment. His second patient had difficulty cooperating with weekly sessions; Vincent was flexible, patient and gentle in trying to engage this patient. He was able to appreciate the mood lability and associated exacerbation in thought disorder that caused variations in the patient's level of cooperation. He did a joint presentation on the Use Antipsychotics in Pregnancy; the presentation was clear, well coordinated, and informative. He handed in one write up, which was comprehensive with a psychodynamically sophisticated formulation.""
Mr. Crabbe's attending in the evaluation clinic rated his performance as at an honors level: ""This is an outstanding medical student. His evaluation patient presentation was smooth, concise, organized and accurate, and delivered without the use of the evaluation document to guide him. This was quite impressive! I appreciated Vincent's professional demeanor with both patients and staff. It was clear to me that he takes both his education and his responsibility as a medical provider quite seriously. His diagnostic assessment and formulation were thoughtful and accurate, which particularly impressed me given that this is Vincent's first experience in psychiatry. Incredible!""

He demonstrated a sophisticated and nuanced approach to his patients which was compassionate, flexible, and extremely effective. Lee took on some of our most challenging and unconventional patients. He worked very closely with a man who recently had a liver transplant who presented as a transfer to the unit from the transplant team with symptoms of delirium or mania. The diagnosis was unclear and there was much debate on the appropriate treatment for this very ill man. Lee did not rush to any conclusions, but rather allowed the clinical information to develop during his work with the patient. He was a very valued member of the team in this regard. Additionally, he showed exceptional patience and maturity as he managed the patient's wife who was having quite a difficult time managing the stresses of her husband's illness. Lee helped the team, the patient, and the wife, with his steady presence. Lee also did great work with a man admitted with a truly severe and refractory depression who had failed multiple medication trials and ECT was not an option for him given terrible cognitive side effects. Lee read a recent New York Time's article about chronotherapy and he was intrigued. He searched the scientific literature and devised a chronotherapy protocol based on previous studies which could be implemented on our unit. I was very impressed with his excitement, his attention to detail, and his ability to think out of the box, especially when standard treatments had failed. Lee also spent time getting to know the psychosocial stressors which contributed to this man's biological depression, helping the team understand more about the intimacy issues between the patient and his wife which were undoubtedly a major aspect of the recurring illness. Lee will be an excellent house staff officer as he combines academic prowess, intellectual curiosity, attention to detail, with compassion and a lovely sense of laid back humor. His psychological sixth sense will serve him well in whatever field of medicine he eventually goes into. Well done indeed!!!"" Lee' outpatient supervisor agreed with the outstanding evaluation and added that he ""showed thoughtfulness, dedication and curiosity. He will be a great asset to the field of psychiatry."" Overall Lee's clinical performance was one of the strongest by an MCY student that I have seen in several years. He provided extraordinary care for his patients and grew in his clinical skills and knowledge. Lee will make a wonderful physician in whatever field he chooses. I would urge him to pursue his interest in psychiatry as he would make a terrific psychiatrist.","Jordan, Lee",Lee,Jordan,1,5/12/17,2017,3,0.6,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Ron showed initiative during his rotation logging in above average number of major cases. He scrubbed in surgeries from ductal excision to a pulmonary wedge resection. It was impressive to see that he understood the anatomy and resulting pathophysiology manifestation after the CEA. Ron was able to communicate his assessment and plans on a number of patients in a concise and clear manner. He is intense in seeking opportunities to learn and participate. In the operating room, he was able to demonstrate he can perform interrupted inverted suturing of trocar incisions. Ron also came into the operating room to see a colectomy on a patient he saw in clinic, which showed very impressive initiative. When questioned about the relevant anatomy, he was very well read on the subject. He challenged me on a few occasions to defend my reason for surgical or non-surgical management of similar patients. Ron was an excellent student in his urology rotation. He was described as very attentive, smart and interested. It was obvious he spent time reviewing topics related to the patients presenting to clinic. The attending reported that they discussed cases and his discussions showed his excellent fund of knowledge. Ron's presentations were organized and focused. They were impressive because he always developed a management plan for the patients. The staff enjoyed having him in clinic because he went out of his way to help them and was very respectful. Ron was a valuable team member on the colorectal/general surgery service. He demonstrated different physical exam maneuvers to assess for hernias. He took the initiative to seek out new patients to interview in clinic. Ron worked well with the residents in clinic and the OR. He completed an inguinal hernia by performing as the first assistant. He dissected through the layers down to the spermatic cord and later performed the layered closure. During a robotic case he made the incisions and inserted the trocars in a patient with abdominal adhesions without injuring then bowel. During the left colectomy Ron was able to name and identify the relevant vasculature and the find the planes of dissection in different locations. At the end of the case, he closed the sites via running subcuticular sutures as well as surgical interns. Ron also spent time in the vascular clinic and OR with Dr Moglia. He independently arrived at assessments and plans which included thoughtful work ups. He was comfortable with patients and performed complete vascular exams. Ron was able to name the vasculature on CT angiography images. After a short ultrasound tutorial he quickly learned to recognize arteries and veins on exams. Ron performed above the level of his peers. He took on independent projects including a presentation on aortic aneurysm and dissections for the team. It was prompted by his interest that led him into a CABG operation. I personally worked with Ron in the operating room on two laparoscopic cholecystectomies - in both cases he mobilized the gall bladder off the fossa without perforating it or causing bleeding. His control of the hook cautery was exceptional for his lack of surgical training. On his weekend day he took the initiative to scrub in on a craniectomy with our neurosurgeon. His eagerness to be in the operating room was evident and appeared sincere. All residents and Attendings were impressed with his preparation and ability to engage in the discussions surrounding the patient care. On rounds he was thorough in his presentations. Ron continued his strong performance from the rest of the year in the orthopedic and ENT clinics. He was always well read and was able to participate in clinical discussion of pathophysiology of patients. He independently developed management plans and was able provide his reasoning for them. This was only possible due to his outside reading and research, his fund of knowledge was above average in his group. He had limited participation in the operating room due to the individual providers.","Weasley, Ron",Ron,Weasley,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Brown, David"

 She has a sufficient but not outstanding fund of knowledge and is making progress toward using her fund of knowledge in everyday, practical clinical situations.

Her presentations were average (which is to say good!) to slightly above average.   At times they felt rushed and at other times they felt inappropriately detailed - Luna did not seem to grasp when a certain version of a presentation would be appropriate.

He was well prepared for cases and worked diligently on his surgical skills showing good improvement over the month. His presentations were very good;  he took on several complicated ICU patients and was able to present them, by systems, in a thorough and concise manner which is a challenge for many med students at his level. He was cheerful and pleasant to work with and had a sincerity and diligence that set him apart. Vincent will be an excellent doctor.

	Vincent did a great job on his surgery rotation. He has a strong work ethic and made significant improvements over the course of the rotation. He takes constructive criticism well in order to improve all aspects of patient care. His fund of knowledge as well as presentation skills are very good. He willingly takes on complicated patients. Vincent would be an asset to any general surgery residency program.

       Very good  student. Very committed to his patients and to being part of the team. Shows up early. Professional. Very independent learner and clearly spends time preparing for both rounds and cases. Worked very hard to improve his suturing skills.

	Vincent was a great student to have on the team. He was inquisitive and fully engaged. He participated well in the OR and was prepared for his cases. He gave good presentations and took advice and recommendations well. Very good job!
	
       Vincent did well on the surgery service. He was inquisitive and eager to learn and participate both on the floor and in the operating room. His presentations improved throughout his time on service, but still at times lacked individual decision making.

In reviewing his progress notes, it was evident that he understood the important points of a patient's post-hospitalization care. In the discharge of a flap patient, he included instructions about bed elevation, nutrition and seizure medications. During that same case, Colin showed endurance and remained for the majority of the entire case until he was dismissed. In this case as in others, he demonstrated a working knowledge of anatomy. Colin chose a very interesting case to write up, a laparoscopic adrenalectomy for hyperaldosteronism. His understanding of the rational for surgery was clear and his differential diagnosis list was complete. He showed surgical intuition when he included a brief mention of the reason for placement of a drain and the requirements prior to removing it. Most students mention a drain was placed without mentioning its purpose, which Colin appreciated. Colin has a good and calm presence in the OR. He helped get patients in and out of the room to facilitate room turnover. He assisted with myringotomies, middle ear exploration and T&A's. Colin has an awareness and initiative not usually seen in medical students. In the clinic, he performed a thorough H&P presentation including a write up. He was observed doing an ear exam and he performed it with skill. Colin was able to carry out a Dix Hallpike maneuver for BPPV. His discussion of Meniere's disease was impressive for a student at his level. In the orthopedic clinic, he asked insightful questions. His efforts to prepare for clinical encounters were obvious. His questioning of patients demonstrated his knowledge base related to their presenting symptoms and physical findings. Colin helped with a hip replacement and a revision. In both his surgical oncology and vascular surgery clinics, he showed attention to detail in his history taking. He was well prepared for his clinics, which helped him formulate organized H & P's after he interviewed and examined patients. After his presentations, he asked great questions during follow up discussions. His performance improved with each clinic. In his limited operative exposure, he demonstrated understanding of the procedure and the relevant anatomy. Colin worked in the surgical oncology and plastics clinics. His presentations were organized and improved from his earlier patients. He was very affable and patients were happy to talk to him. Dr. Knight found Colin very engaged and motivated. Together they worked on a research project in which Colin was ""fundamental"" in its inception, development and completion. The project resulted in a peer-reviewed journal acceptance and for presentation at a national meeting. Colin did a good job and continues to work to formulate a differential diagnosis (based upon likelihood of condition and severity).","Creevey, Colin",Colin,Creevey,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

He was able to prioritize likely disease processes over unlikely processes. He was able to take histories that highlighted his good knowledge base which is better than most. His relationships with staff were exceptional. Harry evaluated patients with anal cancer and GI motility disorders. After giving him feedback, he returned with great knowledge about their management and work up. Great review of the NCCN guidelines for CRC surveillance, which he gave as a short presentation. The staff found him approachable and helpful, the patients established good rapport with him very quickly. In his plastics surgery rotation, he showed initiative in the operating room and the clinic. While other students wait to be asked to scrub in he was prepared at the bedside gowned up ready to help keep the case moving along. With guidance in both clinics, he was able to focus his reading to improve his performance in subsequent clinical exposures. Harry had a strong performance with the ENT clinic. He demonstrated a broad knowledge in ENT above that of his class. His self-directed reading was evident in his participation in the development of the plan for the patients. When questioned about his reasoning for his plans Harry communicated his position with thoughtful reasoning. In a rotation where the students are normally shadowing Harry was able to make a significant impression on one ENT surgeon by taking initiative and remaining engaged. Harry's performance in the orthopedic OR and clinics was described in similar fashion. Harry went beyond the needed commitment as a student (behaves more like a resident) when evaluating patients, making a differential diagnosis and composing a treatment plan. When assigned to research topics he does so thoroughly. He would find time in busy clinics to discuss his finding, many times doing iso by applying information he had learned to a new patient from a prior clinic. He was able to evaluate and develop a treatment plan for anal fissures and gall bladder polyps on the level of an intern. He was so trusted by his mentor that he was asked to communicate to another specialist about the findings and recommendations on patients, which is a role usually reserved for residents. ""Harry will perform and achieve fantastically at the residency of his choice"" according to one general surgeon. Harry's most outstanding feature during his inpatient rotation was his initiative. He was always looking for ways to reduce the work load on the resident team. He sought out opportunities to participate in cases and consults. In addition when one of the seniors provided constructive criticism he made the necessary changes to his presentations. Multiple residents commented that he was interested in all aspects of team and was an enthusiastic participant on rounds. He contributed to the formulation of plans for patients. His technical skills were appropriate for his level.","Potter, Harry",Harry,Potter,1,12/22/17,2017,8,,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

Pansy performed extremely well despite a challenging service. She was an eager learner who responded very well to feedback, and I felt that my early critiques were quickly incorporated into her presentations and her floor skills. She was excited to learn floor skills to make herself more helpful to the team. She is intelligent and hardworking and was a very pleasant member of the team. She was extremely professional and well prepared at all times throughout the rotation. Her enthusiasm to learn was apparent throughout the rotation, and I think that excitement and eagerness will ensure that she will continue to perform extremely well for the rest of this year and into residency as well.

Very good fund of knowledge. Made noticeable strides to fill in gaps in knowledge. Presentations were solid and management plans were appropriate for level. Very good in the OR in assisting cases, anticipating needs before they were verbalized.

Pansy was an engaged and enthusiastic student. While she is not interested in pursuing surgery as a career, she made a point of participating in the OR to gain diverse experiences on thoracic. Her oral presentations were good when I first started working with Pansy but they improved noticeably over the course of the service. She really paid attention to recommendations she was given and implemented them on rounds. I was always impressed by her ability to include details about patients in a concise, organized way and make nuanced plans for her patients in which she considered alternative outcomes based on the results of certain labs or studies.

	Great team member Always came prepared and was involved in patients` care

	Always willing to help with tasks, engaged with patients, appropriate conduct in the operating room

	Seamus was a great asset to our service. He was enthusiastic and eager to learn. He even researched his own interests to share as teaching points during rounds. His bedside manner was above average, and he was prepared with succinct yet complete oral presentations on rounds. He actively sought out feedback to improve his skills and better serve the team. Always willing to help out the team in any way he could. His knowledge and involvement in the team absolutely grew over the month.

	Seamus may be one of my favorite students this year. He was friendly and professional. His effort was a keystone to integrating onto the surgical service. He was always available to help and eager to learn. His medical knowledge was fair but he demonstrated great discipline regarding independent reading after we had discussed something. The healthcare team enjoyed working with Seamus- everyone from aides, nurses, residents, and attending enjoyed his presence.  Seamus was a welcome addition to the surgical team.

Vincent (Vincent) was a fantastic medical student and a pleasure to work with. This was his first clinical rotation and he approached it with wonderful curiosity and dedication. His bedside manner with patients is remarkable and he shows great empathy in his approach to their care. By the end of his rotation, his presentations were clear, well thought out and showed a great deal of thought, evidence based medicine, and effort. He was an excellent team player, professional and respectful in every way and enthusiastic about sharing what he learned with the team and his co-students. He is a great pleasure to work with. 

Fund of knowledge: Vincent comes with an excellent level of knowledge for someone just starting his clinical year. he is easily able to follow along with high level conversations, remembers pathophysiology from his lectures very well, and explains clearly and succinctly disease processes we ask about. 
Patient care skills: Vincent has that wonderful, ideal kindness only some caregivers have. When he had a patient where ambulation and rehab were a concern, he would go on walks with her in the afternoon to motivate her. He is tender, sincere, and caring. Moreover he is an excellent listener and goes the extra mile. For an ESRD patient new to the US (here for dialysis placement), she asked about the possibility of renal transplant. He called the renal transplant office to learn more about the process and what resources would be best to give the patient and her family, which they were extremely appreciative for. My only hope is he continues to show these traits as he becomes busier and more senior. 
Presentations: Vincent had a surprisingly good first H&P presentation. he worked on it without much assistance until 8:30 PM, reviewed with our resident for around an hour, and really sailed. He also continued to get better at followup presentations. He has an ability to speak slowly, clearly, and succinctly that often evades most of us until we are more senior. As such his presentations are very easy to follow along. I have no doubt that as his clinical acumen grows he will become more comfortable with presenting plans. 
Communication skills: He did an excellent job asking questions appropriately and always told us when he would be gone. More importantly, Vincent is nearly fluent in spanish. He was an IMMENSE help in many situations, being able to help communicate information to our patients better than anyone else on the team. He was able to discuss his patient with consultants without any issue and present complex developments to the rest of the team. 
Professionalism: Exceptional professionalism, always self-directed and easily coachable. Made the most of his time and worked without complaint. Always pleasant to have around. 
Team work: Always had the ""no task too small"" mentality.  
Teaching: Did not have the opportunity to see him give a chalk talk. That being said I asked his multiple times to look up differentials for diseases and he always did a good job. He would also come back from preceptor sessions with good ideas for patients. 

Vincent Crabbe
Fund of knowledge: Good. Vincent asked questions that indicated a solid fund of knowledge and a sincere interest in advancing that knowledge past his current level of understanding.
Patient care skills: Vincent was thorough in his physical exams and history-taking, and can continue to work on focusing his evaluations on the patient's chief complaint.
Presentations: Vincent made significant improvements in his ability to present without relying on textual aids during rounds and was consistently formulaic in his presentations.
Communication skills: Vincent took an active role in communicating care plans for his patients with other team members, and he should continue to strive to take on more responsibility for his patients as he progresses through the year.
Professionalism: Excellent. Vincent actively sought out feedback and quite clearly incorporated what he received from all members in his subsequent presentations (e.g. presenting from memory, improving length) or performances of specific tasks (e.g. preparing notes early, closing the loop regarding completed care tasks).
Team work: Excellent. Vincent was an integral part of the care team for his patients and took it upon himself to identify tasks that he could perform that would help the team.  He clearly communicated his obligations to optimize the team's performance and his own medical education.
Teaching: Vincent would often share facts from independent research about clinical topics related to his patients, but should be prepared to offer presentations that might more thoroughly educate his team on the topic of interest.

Vincent was on my sister team, so I did not interact with him much, though his admission presentation on one patient was very well done. His assessment captured the key medical issues with his patient. 

I did not work with Vincent directly but found him to be very pleasant and kind, and I expect will improve with time. Overall he was very easy to work with and his Spanish skills are a huge help! He will require more training in a focused physical/history. 


ALLEN ATTENDINGS

Vincent Thorton
Fund of knowledge
- Vincent was on par for his level and similar to peers, of note he was very much active in learning more about his patients diagnoses and learning the relevant pathophysiology along with asking relevant questions
Patient care skills
- Vincent would be proficient to complete the entire history without any nudging and identified relevant details for the patients initial and follow up presentations
- his physical exam will continue to prosper although at this time he has the basics of the general medical exam
Presentations 
- I could see a very quick and dramatic improvement from day 1 on-ward to his presentation skills including details presented and team plan. I suggested for Vincent to work on differential diagnosis and assessment more than his plan for each problem. His presentations were very detailed/accurate although needed to be more directed towards the admitting diagnosis. Also at times Vincent's order of presentation was jumbled with details from subjective, objective data, assessment, and plan; although he finished with a complete and concise assessment/plan.
Communication skills
- Vincent had great communication with the patient/team and was a valuable part in helping with translation of spanish speaking only patients
Professionalism- Vincent was very professional throughout his rotation and had a great enthusiastic to learn attitude.
Team work- Without any prompting Vincent would help the team with even the smallest tasks and go above and beyond without question.
Teaching- Vincent during his patient presentation would add knowledge and teach what he acquired in reading about his patients medical problems. ","Crabbe, Vincent",Vincent,Crabbe,,2/24/17,2017,1,0.6,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

SPE - Medicine Clerkship,MCY,MEDI,MEDI 7202,Short Answer,Comments from house staff and attendings,,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"
Lavender Brown is a bright and motivated medical student with fine potential, who actively sought to maximize her clinical skills and fund of knowledge in this very important clerkship rotation.  Her working fund of knowledge ably grew during the four weeks, and she clearly responded to the constructive criticism and feedback given to her with improved understanding of disease states and their very tight correlation with underlying pathophysiologic principles of disease.  Indeed, as such principles were applicable to subsequent case studies in the course of this clerkship, they were ably and effectively applied.  Likewise, her clinical skills of comprehensive history taking, over time, showed appropriate balance given to the development of the present illness, but with sufficient acknowledgement and understanding of co-morbid conditions and ancillary illnesses.  In a parallel manner, with resident and hospitalist oversight and continued practice, her physical examination skills also nicely evolved.  Case studies became more methodically secure with balanced understanding of the primary process and the ancillary issues, and with sound development of a full discussion and differential diagnosis.  Indeed, it was gratifying to see this magnitude of growth in the four weeks of this clerkship.

Ms. Brown showed took an active interest in her team responsibilities, and communicated well, and often, to the residents and hospitalists primarily involved in the care of her patients.  She was also an engaging and active resource of important clinical follow-up information on her patients, on whom she regularly rounded.

ALLEN HOUSESTAFF

I think what was most impressive about Viktor was his presentations - ALWAYS almost completely by memory and making eye contact with the attendings and residents throughout. This was not the occasional presentation, either - the thought and effort that went into every single presentation that Viktor did was clearly evident. His knowledge base was also suburb but it was how humble and gracious he is that set him apart. I remember one day during rounds I couldn't answer a series of questions about the bleeding risk of ulcers that the attending had asked me. Viktor approached me after rounds that day and taught me about the Forrest Classification and did so in the most professional and gracious manner. It was an absolute pleasure working with Viktor and he will be a tremendous member of any house staff team. 

Viktor was an outstanding medical student. His notes were excellent and presentations were detailed and thorough. He always offered his help to the team and was constantly enthusiastic. He was a pleasure to work with.  Excels in each of the areas of fund of knowledge, communication skills, patient care, professionalism, etc.

Viktor had an impressive fund of knowledge given the point he is in his training. He delivered excellent presentations from memory and did a fantastic job synthesizing complex patients. He worked really well with the team and his fellow students and developed excellent therapeutic relationships with his patients, who really valued having him as part of their care team. He also did a great job building his fund of knowledge based on the patients he took care of and asked well thought out questions. He frequently asked for feedback and used it to improve this notes and presentations. Overall he was very hardworking and humble and a very valuable great asset to the team, functioning at the level of a sub-intern. 

Viktor: Viktor was extremely pleasant to work with. He was a team member, and spent a significant amount of time digging through the chart for patients with complicated past medical histories. Any questions that encountered during that process he was diligent about finding an answer to and always had thoughtful questions about his patients. He has an excellent bedside manner and was very helpful when it came time to organizing things for discharge such as making follow-up appointments and/or counseling patients on how to take medications. I think Viktor's fund of knowledge is well beyond where I would expect a student's to be given his stage of training.

He is insightful, thorough, inquisitive, respectful of others and humble. He is consistently pleasant and does not become discouraged in suboptimal situations. 
His fund of knowledge is excellent and he readily thinks about  appropriate differential diagnoses. 
He has excellent patient care skills and performed an observed history and physical on a patient who was willing, but hard to understand. Viktor developed rapport with the patient readily and the patient confided new information to Viktor. His physical exam was thorough and he was very interested in learning additional techniques.
Viktor writes extremely well and he readily incorporated constructive comments into his future work.
He presents easily from memory and his case presentations were thoughtful. It is apparent that he enjoys teaching and sharing information with his peers. He participates in the team discussions and asks excellent, thought provoking questions.
Viktor is very professional and even with a heavy work load, completed and turned in his assignments before the deadline.
I believe that Viktor will continue to build on his already high level of skill performance and will be be a physician who uses knowledge, empathy, and clinical acumen to engender trust from his patients. This is especially important at this time since many outside influences are attempting to reduce the importance of the physician to patient bond.","Krum, Viktor",Viktor,Krum,2,12/21/17,2017,8,0.6,G,General,"Cocks, Patrick"

I worked with Mr. Malfoy in the Allen ICU.  He gave excellent presentations and his work ethic was admirable. 
He did a superb job fitting in and integrating himself with the ICU team.  He always ensured that all plans for his patients were carried out throughout the day.
His medical knowledge was appropriate for a student of his level of training. 

Draco did his internal medicine rotation with our team at the Allen ICU.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with his fund of knowledge and willingness to help the team.  He was a tremendous asset to our team and was eager to learn and teach other medical students lessons in critical care.  His fund of knowledge increased throughout the rotation and he was able to apply his fund of knowledge appropriately in clinical settings.  In addition, his presentations were organized and concise, and he was able to communicate with patients and their families on a professional and personal level.  He was a pleasure to work with overall. 

Draco's presentations are the best I have ever heard from a medical student. The presentations are thorough and organized. His pace and diction are clear and readily understandable. To his credit, an attending physician came into the ICU while Draco was presenting, and could not believe that he was a medical student.
In addition to his presentations, Draco is smart and motivated. His knowledge is at or slightly above his level of training. He is always willing to do anything to help the team and his enthusiasm really helped morale in a sometimes depressing unit. He readily accepts feedback and incorporates it into his practice.
Overall he was really a pleasure to work with.

Dudley is a fantastic medical student, who is always enthusiastic and brings daily positivity to the team.  He works hard, gives thorough and clear presentations, is up to date on current medical literature, and takes initiative to be as helpful as possible. 

Dudley was a great addition to our ICU team. He was enthusiastic and always willing to jump in and help the team. He knew his patients incredibly well. (One of his first days in the ICU the attendings took away his notes and made him present a complex patient from scratch and he knew the patient inside and out. He asked thought provoking questions on rounds, brought in primary research to share with the team and had a great fund of knowledge. He is well on his way to being a fantastic clinician! 

Dudley Dudley
Fund of knowledge  Dudley is extremely curious and very motivated in learning. His knowledge continues to grow since I worked with him at the start of his MC year. 
Patient care skills: Outstanding work in collecting data. Very diligent. Sometimes could be a little long-winded in his medical history reporting though. 
Presentations: Very clear, not completely from memory.  
Communication skills: Dudley did a wonderful job consulting and speaking with services. 
Professionalism Outstanding!! 
Team work: Dudley is such a wonderful team player, top notch!! Always willing to help others. 
Teaching: Does a great job working with others.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to evaluate Lee. 
I have had the chance to work with him on the medical floor of Bronx VA hospital. It's been a pleasure. Lee's patient care skills are the worth mentioning here. His professional way of dealing with patients helped him gain the trust of patients and obtain detailed history and examination. 
He is a very well dressed individual who is always open to constructive criticism and always working to improve his knowledge. 
I wish him a very best of luck in his future. He will make a really good physician. 

I had the opportunity to work with Lee Jordan for a period of about a week. 
In that time, he demonstrated a willingness to learn, and showed a good fund of knowledge. He portrayed a good knack at obtaining history and performing physicals, following up with accurate presentations, adequately depicting what was going on, and demonstrating an understanding of the pathophysiology.
He was able to appropriately communicate findings, problems, solutions, to members of the team.
He showed A good team approach, integrating easily, also interacting  naturally and easily with fellow students. 
All in all, motivated, hardworking.
I wish him all the best.

It was a pleasure to be Lee Jordan's medical preceptor during his time at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center.  He had an excellent grasp of Internal Medicine for someone so early in his clinical career. His presentations were lucid, complete and well-organized.  He had a solid grasp of pathophysiology. Furthermore, Lee impressed the the housestaff with his warmth, empathy and enthusiasm. Overall, he compares favorably with the best students I have taught during the past 35 years. ","Jordan, Lee",Lee,Jordan,1,9/22/17,2017,6,0.6,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

These comments may be included in the Dean's Letter.",,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Dr N: Katie bell is a very bright, focused, caring and committed medical student who began this rotation with a strong commitment to maximizing her clinical experience at Stamford Hospital, and indeed, she effectively did this through her many case experiences and her proactive involvement in clinical medicine.  Her learning was predicated on optimally understanding the linkage between the overt medical conditions of her patients and the underlying pathophysiology responsible for these states.  She comfortably and effectively immersed herself in all environs of learning, and was eagerly participatory in teaching rounds and discussions, whether or not the specific cases discussed were patients in whose care she was directly involved.  Her commitment to learning and feedback resulted in progressive and continued growth in history taking, striking that balance between the primary focus on the major reason for admission, but putting this information in the context of all other important historical facets.  She also sought to augment her physical examination skills, and sought and eagerly accepted feedback regarding the development of her skill set.  She gave fine and commanding presentations, with proper balance, emphasis, and thoroughness of detail and correlative evidence based resource information.  She explored the medical literature in depth, and always came up with fine differential diagnoses, with thoughtful discussion of each of the possibilities.

Ms. bell is a fine communicator, and related very well and supportively to all of her patients, eagerly sharing information with them as it became available, and always apprising them of the plan of care and anticipated developments.  She also communicated well to members of our house staff, and the attending physicians and consultants with whom she proactively engaged in conversation.  Her appearance and manner are highly professional, she showed integrity, responsibility and reliable in all of her actions.  She very much thrived on feedback with resultant changes brought into place by her commitment to strive for excellence.  She was very much a team player with her residents, and related very well to her student colleagues with whom she had excellent working relationships.

Commentary made by a senior attending physician was that ""Katie did an outstanding job presenting a patient with dyspnea with great understanding of the pathophysiology involved. She is a quick thinker and well informed. She is most interested and related unusually well with the patient.""

A PG-1 resident wrote that ""Katie is very smart and has great presentations. She is always very well prepared.""  

One of the two Stamford Hospital chief residens wrote that ""Katie is a pleasure to work with and is very hard working. She is thorough with her evaluations and able to concisely present the key points during rounds. She appropriately follows-up with her patients and communicates with the entire team and nursing staff. She has excellent communication skills and is a team player. Katie will be a great doctor one day as she learns more and is able to translate her medical knowledge into clinical practice.""

A PG-1 resident who worked closely with her noted that: ""Katie knew her patients inside and out and was always willing to go back and get more information from the patients.  Her presentations on rounds were polished and her notes were excellent; she always knew the plan for each patient she followed.  Her discharge summaries were extremely thorough, accurate, and a great help to the medical team.  My only constructive criticism would be to speak louder and more confidently, because what she has to say is very valuable.""

Lee's performance was superb throughout his medical rotation at the Bronx VA.  
Lee's fund of knowledge of basic and clinical sciences is more than sufficient to evaluate patients with complex medical problems.  His grasp of basic science and clinical medicine is first-rate. He demonstrates insight and clinical judgment and is able to distill what is most important and integrate complex medical and psychosocial information to inform differential diagnosis.  In taking a history, Lee gathers relevant data comprehensively and accurately using a hypothesis-driven, thoughtful, empathic and skilled approach.  He performs a complete and accurate physical exam employing relevant maneuvers and interprets findings correctly.  He acquires and interprets data in formulating sophisticated diagnosis and management plans that take account of patient-specific factors and anticipates possible outcomes.  
Lee generates appropriate and prioritized differential diagnoses and understands sources of bias in interpretation.  His presentations are consistent, organized and succinct, and delivered with great self-assurance.  He produced excellent preceptor write-ups, admission notes, and follow-up notes with concise formulations and appropriate scholarship.  Lee demonstrates highly sophisticated understanding and integration of multiple perspectives of patients, fellow students, and members of the team, and raises the level of discussion in rounds and preceptor sessions.  By virtue of his very excellent communication skills, he has a positive impact on patient care (behavior change, goals of care, delivering bad news).  He shows great energy, empathy, warmth and humor and relates well to patients, students, and staff.

Pansy was my student on Allen ICU and I truly enjoyed working with her. She was very professional and she showed up to work eager to learn. She was very helpful in the ICU with tasks and always sought out procedures to perform such as arterial blood draws. In terms of presentations, I was very impressed with Pansy's thoroughness and confidence. She knew her patients well and her attention to detail was impressive. Pansy's fund of knowledge is where I would expect for a student early in clerkship year, but I was very impressed by her constant drive for improvement. For example, she would go home and read NEJM review articles on acid-base disorders and hypoxemia to improve her knowledge. Overall, I was very impressed with Pansy, and I would be very happy to work with her again.   

I worked for a brief time with Pansy. Her fund of knowledge was very good, and she was functioning at a level appropriate for her time spent on MCY. Her presentations were very well organized. She was always very eager to learn and to help out the team. Very good team player!

Also she shares her knowledge and discuss various cases with fellow team members. 
Finally I am privileged to work with Patil, and it was immense pleasure. She is one of the most compassionate individuals towards patients. I wish her all the best for her future.  

Patient care skills: Great job in collecting history and physical exam findings and able to identify key physical findings.

Communication skills: Excellent communication skills including patient, team, and staff. 
Team work: Great team player, always offering her help,

I had the pleasure of working with Ms. Patil Parvati on the medicine floor. 
Her fund of knowledge is good and she was always curious to learn. 
She was a consummate professional always being on time and courteous with all her colleagues.
One incident that stood out for me was the way she handled the situation of an agitated patient. It was early in the morning even before Ms. Parvati was scheduled to come in to work and one of her patient's was suspected of having a stroke. When she came in early and became aware of the situation, she immediately went to the patient's room. I being the on-call resident/intern, was called to see the patient. That's when I had the opportunity to witness not just her patient care skills but her amazing communication skills. The patient was agitated and was not letting anybody near him. But when we walked into the room, it was clear she had a built a relationship of trust with her patient & was able to talk to him in a very personable way to calm him down. She demonstrated the important ability of staying calm amidst chaos. She demonstrated good physical exam skills and good knowledge of her patient's previous medical history, the changes she noticed in his physical exam, current treatment plan and goals of care of the patient. The way she handled herself in the situation and her ability to form a relationship of trust with her patients will take her a long way. I would be more than happy if I had someone as my Doctor with her communication skills and approach. 

She is very ambitious and hard working student, very knowledgeable and approachable. She has an amazing relation towards both residents and patients. 

Briefly, Patil Parvati, We call her P""; is a exceptional student who I believe can  ""walk on waters"" might be a understatement.
Well is all seriousness my feedback is as follows:
Fund of knowledge : She is always interested in learning more and brings back diseases to the pathophysiology; not only learns but teaches in the process. She ties the knowledge to real patient by explaining / counselling the patient in lay language.
Patient care skills: She is above average in History taking and her examination skills are exceptional. 
Presentations: She is a confident storyteller; understands pertinent + and -ives.
Communication skills: excellent
Professionalism: Respectful and calm soul. Very professional. 
Team work: never delinquent; understands her role in given team work; leads by example when put to it.

Bronx VA Attendings 

I worked with Patil. Parvati during her first week on the wards on the medicine service at the Bronx VA.   
She quickly adapted to the inpatient service and was eager to take care of the patients on her team and learn about their diseases and medical history.  
Her presentations were clear, and she was appropriately able to hone in on the relevant details and establish a differential diagnosis.  I often noticed that she was asking her senior resident questions about the patients she was following.  She was eager for feedback about her presentation style and continually wanted to improve her skills from the first day.  

It was a delight supervising Patil Parvati as ward and teaching attending while she rotated through our medical ward 7C at the JJP VA Medical Center. I worked with her from January 17 to 31, 2017.
She has an astonishing medical knowledge including of many of the latest research studies. She leaves out no opportunity to expand her knowledge by reading up on all patients and their clinical problems whom she is involved in. Her patient presentation skills, both written and verbal, are at a high level, even though this is her very first clinical rotation. Her history taking is detailed, yet she knows how to separate important information of high priority from secondary data. She goes through great length to obtain details on significant remote medical events through our extensive medical record system to get a comprehensive picture of the patient. In particular, she skillfully incorporates details on the patient's psychiatric and psychosocial history into her report. Her physical examination is just as thorough, and she knows how to emphasize abnormal and relevant normal findings in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. Her progress notes are at the same time detailed and concise and are well organized. And again, she constantly seeks feedback on how to improve her note-writing skills.
In her first clinical rotation, Patil adapted quickly to the new work environment working closely with her team of residents from day one. She eagerly took on new patients whom she would follow longitudinally engaging closely with the physicians who saw her patients in follow-up after discharge. Patil relates well to her patients and their relatives, and her genuine empathy comes across naturally. She has an extraordinary ability to communicate with patients on their level. When we asked the patients, it became clear that they had a good understanding of their illness and its treatment. She is also a great team player, and her hard work and collaborative spirit was appreciated by residents, nurses, social workers, and attendings alike. She also tries to understand the meaning of illness for a patient on a spiritual and
philosophical level. She shared several papers describing stories of patients (some of them physicians) who not only coped with their physical disabilities but went on to accomplish great achievements in their fields.
Patil gave an extraordinary presentation to the whole team on a patient with idiopathic vomiting, including data from the very latest literature on the topic. With great ease, she moved between very different aspects of the disease, from psychological aspects down to the receptors involved in various antiemetic drugs. This was a scholarly presentation of a level we see rarely even with residents or fellows.
Patil' pleasant personality is matched by her self-confidence that gives rise to an assertiveness that, employed with characteristic gentleness, serves her well when she advocates for patients, asks questions, or makes contributions to the medical team's treatment plan.
One area which Patil will improve on is to project her voice well, so everybody hears the important things she has to say. We agreed that one way to go about practicing this is to go to the banks of the Hudson River and sing contemporary Brazilian songs in a way that the people in New Jersey can hear them.
Overall, Patil has shown to be an exceptional student with an inquisitive mind coupled with a steep learning curve, a strong commitment to caring for a patient in a holistic fashion, and a great sense of team spirit.
We hope you will send her back to us for future clinical rotations. ","Parvati, Patil",Patil,Parvati,,3/31/17,2017,2,0.6,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

Patil's fund of knowledge of basic and clinical sciences is clearly sufficient to evaluate patients with complex medical problems. Ê She demonstrates insight and clinical judgment and is able to distill what is most important and integrate complex medical and psychosocial information to inform differential diagnosis. Ê In taking a history, Patil gathers relevant data comprehensively and accurately using a hypothesis-driven, thoughtful, empathic and skilled approach. Ê She performs a complete and accurate physical exam employing relevant maneuvers and interprets findings correctly. Ê She acquires and interprets data in formulating sophisticated diagnosis and management plans that take account of patient-specific factors and anticipates possible outcomes. Ê 
Patil generates appropriate and prioritized differential diagnoses and understands sources of bias in interpretation. Ê Her presentations are consistent, organized and succinct, and delivered with self-assurance. Ê Although her early write-ups needed some refinement, she wrote excellent admission and follow-up notes with concise formulations and appropriate scholarship. Ê ÊPatil shows Êsophisticated understanding and integration of multiple perspectives of patients, fellow students, and members of the team, and raises the level of discussion in rounds and preceptor sessions. Ê It is notable that Patil is trilingual (in English, Portugese and Spanish).

Luna (Luna) Lovegood
Patient care skills: Luna showed great empathy and caring in working with her patients. She assisted in caring for a particularly difficult patient in the ICU who had a complicated psychiatric and substance abuse history, and remained calm and collected in working with the patient. She has excellent bedside manner and technical skills.
Presentation: Luna's presentations were clear, and she continued to gain confidence in her presentation skills throughout the rotation.
Professionalism: Luna maintained a positive attitude throughout the rotation and demonstrated enthusiasm for learning and participating in patient care. She collaborated with the other medical students on the team, all of whom were sub-Is, and graciously took the opportunity to learn from their experience.
Team work: Luna was an active team member and was extremely helpful in obtaining collateral information about our patients, which is an essential component of ICU level care. 

Luna did a great job on her time in the Allen ICU.  The ICU is an extremely challenging place to work early in clinical rotations, and during Luna's time we had very complex patients.  Luna quickly adapted and in no time was mastering complicated medical topics.  She was extremely responsible, thorough and always eager to help.  She was also very responsive to feedback and it showed in how quickly she learned to present and manage very complex patients.  

Luna (Luna) Lovegood
- Fund of knowledge: Luna has a great fund of knowledge, and was very proactive in reading about her patients and supplementing and building on what she knows to round out her understanding of her patients. She was very motivated in immersing her self in really getting to know her patients.  
- Patient care skills: Luna was very diligent and thorough in her H&Ps. She was dedicated to spending additional time with her patients to fully understand their presentations, and in several instances her conversations with her patients and their outpatient providers directly impacted our treatment plans (for example, in collecting history about prior ARVs her patient had tried to help us craft a new regimen for his HIV given newly discovered tenofovir toxicity). 
- Presentations: Luna gave excellent presentations. She was thorough and succinct, and even in the setting of sensitive bedside presentations she was able to present cases in a way that was sensitive to the patient yet honest and thorough for the team. She handled herself extremely well! 
- Communication skills: Luna had excellent communication skills. She continuously checked in on her patients, and developed warm, caring therapeutic relationships with them which I know the patients appreciated. She was also instrumental in helping to communicate with outpatient providers and family members to help make their transitions of care more seamless and effective. 
- Professionalism and attitude: Luna was always very professional and respectful to everyone around her. She was very dedicated and hardworking, and her excellent work ethic came across in her interactions with the team. 
- Team work: Luna was an integral member of our team and did an excellent job of helping to carve out her own effective role on the team. She was proactive and accomplished tasks she could help with without even being asked. She certainly helped make our work (and the care of her patients!) easier and more efficient. 
- Teaching: Luna was very proactive about contributing to our teams' education as well, both through using her presentations as opportunities for reading and teaching points, and through topic presentations she gave during rounds.  
Overall, Luna was a key member of our team and an excellent medical student, and I thoroughly enjoyed working with her!


ALLEN ATTENDINGS

Fund of knowledge-average
Patient care skills-average
Presentations-this was a weakness.  She completely read an entire presentation from her computer and was switching between screens to look for data.  She did not seem to have memorized any of the presentation.
Professionalism-average

She was professional with a good attitude (professionalism).  She was effective and always willing to help (teamwork).  The one or two presentations I heard were clear and accurate, not too lengthy (appropriate), but not necessarily from memory.  

Luna did not get the opportunity to be observed too long but her one presentation was thoughtful and well formatted.

Luna:
Fund of knowledge : outstanding, often had intern level understanding of situations
Patient care skills: excellent- helped the residents considerably
Presentations: outstanding- very clear thinking and all relevant details presented
Communication skills: excellent, only weakness is that she is a bit quiet, but works very well with patients and families
Professionalism : excellent
Team work: outstanding- helped out everyone a lot
Teaching: outstanding- presentations excellent 

Fund of knowledge great fund of knowledge and she continues to read on new topics
Patient care skills: thorough histories, did not watch her do PE
Presentations: could be long, repeating same info several times, continue to practice presentations focusing on pertinent details. No need to report everything the patient tells you, but try to paint a picture of what you think is going on to guide to your top diagnosis within your differential. practice out loud, this will help your efficiency 
Communication skills: soft spoken, but respectful. interacts well with staff and patients
Professionalism hardworking with a positive attitude, encourage you to become more outspoken
Team work: per team helped with all aspects of patient care
Teaching: did several small presentations on questions raised during rounds the previous day in concise, easy to digest modules 

Luna Lovegood demonstrated excellent bedside manner, empathy, and solid knowledge base, and enthusiasm during our busy ICU rotation during which we interacted for under a week. She was initially guarded, much as we all were this early in our training but displayed a real sense of caring, warm bedside demeanor and a strong interest  in learning and teachability. Superb beginning, portends a very promising future. 

Luna did a very good job in the Allen ICU during her MCY rotation.  She participated in rounds and academic discussions. ","Lovegood, Luna",Luna,Lovegood,,3/31/17,2017,2,0.4,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

ALLEN HOUSESTAFF

Penelope was incredible. For some of our most complicated patients she really took the time to read and think and pushed our differential as a team, most memorably when she synthesized a patient's delirium, negative tox screen, and complex social history into a compelling diagnosis of clonazepam withdrawal. In advancing her patients' care she was our de facto sub-I for the two weeks she was on service. She was able to manage multiple complicated patients with ease. She is also a pro at a-sticks, has an impressive fund of knowledge, and is sharply attuned to team dynamics. Really a pleasure to work with. 

Fund of knowledge: Penelope's fund of medical knowledge was excellent. Not only did she enter the rotation with a substantial grasp of pathophysiology and management, but Penelope consistently read up on patients and conditions. She shared her learning with the medical team, acting not only as a curious learner but also educator 
Patient care skills: empathic, patient-centered, took the time to talk to patients and hear their concerns which often led to new clinically-relevant information being unearthed
Presentations: succinct, contained all relevant information, accurate
Communication skills: practice closed-loop communication, reliable, comfortable talking to consultants. Was especially impressed one busy afternoon when she provided signout to accepting team for transfer for a patient she had not formally followed, which demonstrated how engaged she as in all patients' care
Professionalism: outstanding. Worked well with all members of interdisciplinary team. Responsible, thoughtful, kind, team player. Took on tasks not exclusive to her dedicated patients she was following.
Team work: as above, exceedingly collaborative. 

Penelope shows clear enthusiasm for Medicine and goes out of her way to make sure that she is learning, requesting and giving feedback, and taking care of her patients. She is working hard to prepare herself for residency by taking on more patients and more patient care tasks. She is rapidly developing her clinical knowledge and develops thorough plans for patients' work-up. She can continue to improve by building her confidence with less common diagnoses and by practicing using open-ended questions in patient interviews.

Penelope was an exceptional medical student during my time working with her over the course of a week in the Allen ICU. Her presentations were extremely succinct, well organized and thorough, which was perfect for the ICU setting. It was very impressive how she also managed to present mostly from memory, which is something very difficult to do in ICU patients with many ongoing active issues. She chose to admit and follow patients that were particularly interesting and very challenging from a diagnostic and management standpoint - in particular she worked up a young patient with severe acidosis (pH<6.9) with acute ketoacidosis of unclear etiology and helped tremendously with her management by finding case reports of very similar presentations. She continued to follow the patients after completing the rotation and updated me on their condition after I had left the service as well.  She was an avid self-directed learner and often looked up journal articles and reviews related to active issues with several of her patients - this was extraordinarily helpful for both patient management and education of the entire team. Penelope was truly a team player and it would be great to work with her again in the future!

ALLEN ATTENDINGS

General-Penelope was enthusiastic throughout her rotation but sometimes she had trouble finding her place within the team. 
Fund of knowledge - curious and motivated.
Patient care skills: took good history and reported okay physical exams. 
Presentations: clear and succinct, also accurate however not from memory. 
Communication skills: she made honest attempt to communicate with the team, but sometimes spoke up at odd times. 
Professionalism - not particularly self directed, has some preoccupation performance. 
Team work: definitely tried to be team player
Teaching: do not remember if this occurred or not so cannot comment. 

Fund of knowledge -	Intellectually curious, showed that she was reading about her patients. One patient in particular was complicated medically, unclear etiology of her metabolic disarray, delirium and respiratory failure.  While the whole team up to the attending was stumped, Penelope kept up with the team bringing up possibilities in the differential diagnosis, suggesting workup to help narrow the Ddx, and taking it upon herself to read up on some of the rarer possibilities.  She was also very consistent with asking questions to fill knowledge gaps. 
Patient care skills - In the above case, Penelope diligently pursued collateral information on her patients to help us better understand the clinical context and to add to or narrow our Ddx. 
Presentations -	I honestly don't recall that her presentations were from memory, but they were clear, accurate and succinct.  On occasion she would need to review in the EMR for details that she did not know off-hand that were relevant to the presentation, but that is part of gaining knowledge of clinical relevance (see patient care skills). 
Communication skills - Excellent communication skills.  Had a great rapport with the multidisciplinary staff. Was actively involved w/ consult services.  Consistently developed an outstanding rapport with patient families and as such able to get relevant details that were important to patient care. 
Professionalism - Excellent contributor to the team effort. Integrated well into the team as an MCY student in a busy ICU environment. 
Team work - Excellent contributor to the team effort. Integrated well into the team as an MCY student in a busy ICU environment. 
Teaching - No fellow students. But readily shared knowledge gained from reading specifically about patient, as well as information / collateral history obtained from family and OSH providers.  

Fund of knowledge : very good fund of knowledge and curiosity about physiologic processes. Penelope's curiosity about medicine is impressive, throughout our time she asked great questions and independently researched different topics.
Patient care skills: took complete ownership of her patients, spoke to families and took the time to make patients feel comfortable with the ICU.  Her compassion is truly amazing.
Presentations: Good presentations. Constantly sought feedback on how to improve presentations.
Communication skills: works well with entire multidisciplinary team. Takes time to introduce herself to nurses and ancillary staff.
Professionalism always professional. Engaged and thoughtful )
Team work: ally was an integral part of the team and worked very well with everyone. She volunteered to help in any way she could and was always enthusiastic.
Teaching: independently investigated different patients and offered valuable insight into patient care. ","Clearwater, Penelope",Penelope,Clearwater,,11/17/17,2017,7,0,G,General,"Cutrer, Bill"

Seamus's enthusiasm, eagerness to learn, and teamwork were such a wonderful contribution to the team. He has a good fund of knowledge and a solid foundation. His patient care skills are more than diligent - he once picked up a major finding on history that both residents missed and led to a completely different path for the patient. He was tireless in his efforts to gather collateral, was clear and professional. He will make a wonderful physician in the future, and I was so thrilled to have worked with him. 

Professional, and always willing to help the team. Because of Seamus's detailed history taking, we even discovered that a patient had severe depression and suicidality, something we as the residents had missed; which completely changed the patient's treatment trajectory. Overall Seamus had a great attitude, gave great presentations on rounds, built therapeutic alliances with patients and families, performed detailed histories and physicals and was really nice to work with. 

I worked directly with Seamus and found him to be an essential part of our team by the end of my time with him. He was curious and had a good fund of knowledge. He was diligent and careful with his history and physical exam, and his patients universally loved the sensitive and professional care he provided. His presentations were well-organized and became increasingly focused as the rotation progressed. It was a pleasure to work with Seamus and he will be a great resident. 



ALLEN ATTENDINGS

Seamus was an actively contributing member of our medical team, eager to admit new patients and pick up patients of his own. He followed his patients and presented them very well each morning, though there were occasional details missed. Seamus was clearly reading about his patients at home, which was phenomenal, and he would also read studies that we mentioned on rounds and bring in his perspective on them the following day.


Seamus was always engaged and asking about pathophysiology. He would often take it upon himself to look up the rationale behind decisions and then share with the team. In one impromptu discussion about a patient with an UGIB, Seamus recalled a study he had read about UGIB management and was able to recite the study findings and explain the rationale with ease - the residents did not even know the study in the same level of detail as Seamus did! He also gave an excellent presentation on secondary progressive MS that was clear, concise, and relevant to our patient. His presentations were overall good, but could continue to focus on using the data to tell the patient's story that makes the overall differential and conclusion obvious to the listener. He was always professional, always willing to go above and beyond to help out the team and his patients, and will be a phenomenal resident. ","Finnigan, Seamus",Seamus,Finnigan,,3/31/17,2017,2,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

SPE - Medicine Away Clerkship,MCY,MEDI,MEDI 7202,Short Answer,Comments from house staff and attendings,,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"Dr N: Hermione Granger is a hard-working, conscientious, interactive, and responsible medical student, with an excellent work ethic, who came to this rotation with a highly evident commitment to compete each day with the knowledge and gratification of newly acquired information, and the gratification of making a difference in the lives of the patients with whom she was able to effectively interact as part of the patient care team. Her learning grew continuously and seamlessly each day of this rotation, and it was nurtured by her commitment to understand underlying pathophysiologic principles and the relationship of those principles with the overt clinical diseases states in which her patients presented. Her standards of performance and commitment to continued and progressive growth and development were highly evident throughout.
Relevant to patient care skills, Ms. Granger showed fine skill in history taking, and comfortably covered all of the often multiple medical issues her patients faced, but still securing the preeminence of the fundamental clinical problem while adequately including all other medical issues and needs that had to be addressed. Her physical examination skills grew well, and as an integral component of her much sought feedback to all components of her educational experience, she would seek the counsel and mentorship of residents and attending physicians to confirm the continued refinement of her physical examination skill set. Along with her resident teammates, and as an important member of the patient care team, Ms. Granger took ownership of her patients and actively participated in the case management process. As a result, she had fine mastery of each of her cases, with solid command of her oral presentations, replete with appropriate emphasis, sequence, and balance. Likewise, her written case studies were thoughtfully done, a result of obvious hard work, dedication, and incorporation of evidence based literary resources that greatly enhanced the flow and critical understanding of the many components of her differential diagnosis. Her clinical enthusiasm was evident in the manner of her presentations, and her responsiveness to queries at the end of the presentation from her student colleagues.
Ms. Granger is an excellent communicator. Thoughtful and attentive to the comments and queries of others, but likewise very participatory and engaged in case discussions and teaching rounds, it was evident that she well understood both the dynamics and the indispensability of the rounding process, with the natural flow of relevant clinical pieces of information that were brought to heightened levels of discussion through a mastery of the underlying subject matter. Ms. Granger is also highly professional in manner and conduct, with demonstrable integrity in her commitment to study and learn, and the necessity of its applicability to the care and well-being of her patients. She focused much on the magnitude of her responsibility, and her passion for medicine was underscored by her general concern for thoughtful case work-ups and appropriate studies, continuous efferent response to information and data that was generated, and the necessity of an overall care plan in anticipation of completion of all that could be done on the in-patient service. Her teamwork was evident in her relationship with her student colleagues and with her residents, who gave her high words of praise.
A, MD - did not present a patient to the group. She readily understood medical issues and is average in her knowledge base. She accepted feedback readily.
M, MD - Hermione is an impressive student with a compassionate personality. She is comprehensive in her presentations and follows up closely with patients.
D, MD- Hermione is an intelligent student who is very helpful on the team. She gave a great presentation on refeeding syndrome; it was also well organized and informative.
J, MD - Hermione was a pleasure to work with. She was hardworking, very proactive and always eager to learn and present topics during rounds. When she presented her patients during rounds, it was thorough and very organized. She knew her patients well. Her medical topic presentations were excellent. I would be happy to work with Hermione again! Overall Hermione was one of the best medical students I have had the opportunity to work with. In addition to helping the medicine team out with routine tasks like calling consults and following up labs, she would help the other students out as well and was a great team player, which is always a great thing to see.","Granger, Hermione",Hermione,Granger,,11/17/17,2017,7,0.4,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

He also sought to regularly and consistently augment his foundation of knowledge, and this was consistently done throughout the rotation. He showed much curiosity, and was intellectually rigorous as he held himself to high standards of professional performance. His patient care skills were strong and sound, and as I had the opportunity to serve as his mentor in Primary Care Medicine which he completed just prior to beginning this clerkship, I noted very solid and sustained growth in history taking and physical examination technique. This was evident in his thorough development of the fundamental primary clinical issues, and with additional important ancillary history that created a fuller, three-dimensional understanding of the extent of all clinical issues. His oral presentations were clear, accurate and relevant to each case at hand. It was evident through the material he obtained from his patient questioning was insightful and that his physical examination skills were replete. Through his oral and written case studies, it was also evident that he assiduously utilized available literary resources and that he provided a sound differential diagnosis with thoughtful reasons both for and against a given diagnostic entity.
Mr. Wood has fine communication skills, as he frequently rounded on his patients to regularly garner new and insightful information. Further he empathetically and supportively provided them with important follow-up relevant to their hospitalization. His communication skills additionally extended to the other health care professionals involved in the care of his patients, including residents on his patient care team and supervisory hospitalists who additionally served as team educators. This underscored his commitment and bonding to the patient care team and his work ethic, attitude and professionalism. He very much sought and deeply gained from feedback that was provided to him. Noteworthy was his response to such feedback in the demonstrable growth in his skill set and clinical mastery. He additionally loved to teach and shared knowledge he had attained with his student colleagues.

Oliver often was the one to ask out-of-the box questions, and to have the view from 10,000 feet when analyzing case presentations of his peers.  His own case presentation was certainly challenging in that the individual he chose was a very complicated man with advanced HIV disease, inoperable rectal carcinoma, poorly controlled diabetes, and multiple hospital admissions for recurrent rectal abscesses and bleeding.  Unsurprisingly, this patient had significant socio-economic challenges to managing his own care.  Oliver did his best to present from memory, but this was certainly difficult, and although it was hard to parse out the pathophysiologic  ""pivot points"" in this case, Oliver did a good job identifying the areas of concern in his social support that could be improved upon, thereby improving adherence and the patients overall health.   Oliver's written cases showed consistent improvement during the course of the clerkship.  He responded well to feedback, and was eager to learn.  Oliver's topic presentations gravitated to papers analyzing interventions at an institutional level, whether outpatient clinic programs for obesity management in diabetics or skilled nursing facilities using education programs for their staff to improve care and communication with family of advanced dementia patients.

A very eager and enthusiastic learner with genuine intellectual curiosity. Her knowledge is appropriate for her level of training. Discussions in her write up improved significantly with each submission which reflected growth of knowledge and her ability in applying that knowledge in her work. Her discussions both in oral and in written presentations displayed the expansion of the depth of knowledge as well as the familiarity of the illness. Demonstrated a remarkable improvement in prioritizing differential diagnoses as well as the treatment approach.   
Took into consideration the risk benefits of treatments. A patient she was managing with cancer with metastatic disease to the vertebra resulting in imminent lower spinal cord compression, the    
Team was aggressively pushing for surgery even when the patient was reluctant. Taking everything about the patient into consideration, including the fact that he had been bed bound with inability to ambulate for months, she made a legitimate argument regarding the risk of performing the surgery with the patient refusing and what benefit it would bring the patient. When the medical team was trying to convince the patient, she was the first person, who felt benefits did not outweigh the risks. Subsequently the Neurosurgeon who evaluated the patient, came to the same conclusion as her.
She is almost at the level of an Educator

Took initiative in all aspects of clinical work and never had to be prodded in to taking some form of action to help her patients such as contacting patient PMD or discussing with consultants, social worker etc. Was thoroughly involved in the management of her patients and took the lead and owned her patients. 


Residents:
Quiet but worked closely with us. Very good knowledge, gave a few presentations on specific topics which were extensively researched with up to date information which helped to advance our knowledge on the subject. She was functioning as an intern and not as a student.
Presentations were detailed and from memory. Very helpful and pleasant.","Weasley, Ginny",Weasley,Ginny,,11/17/17,2017,7,0.4,G,General,"Phillipi, Carrie"

SPE - Medicine Away Clerkship,MCY,MEDI,MEDI 7202,Short Answer,Comments from house staff and attendings,,,,,Summary,Evaluation,"MD: Neville Longbottom is a conscientious, bright, and thoughtful student began this rotation with a sound infrastructure gained from his earlier basic science education as well as the more than ten months of this major clinical year that had already transpired and which included a wide spectrum of antecedent clinical experiences. In addition, there was definable growth and refinement of this foundation base, with gratifying and demonstrative linkage of newly acquired clinical growth to underlying pathophysiologic principles. In a parallel manner, his clinical command relevant to his required five formal case studies, and the associated history taking and physical examination skills also demonstrated definable growth in accrual of technique and focus, as well as in demonstrable confidence and command. Along with the house staff team, with whom he worked closely and assiduously, he very much felt ownership and responsibility of these cases, and strove for thoroughness and refinement. His ease of accessing the medical literature, and finding relevant corroboration to strengthen his differential diagnoses were also fine traits that readily grew throughout the rotation. His presentations showed case knowledge, not overlooking all aspects to relate, but clearly with the appropriate balance and emphasis relevant to the predominant and presenting clinical issues. His written case studies, as well, were thoughtfully done with much effort and energy that went into their creation.
Mr. Longbottom is a fine communicator, and his frequent clinical rounding on his patients provided support, empathy, and reinforcement of the quality of care that they were receiving along with the anticipated future studies that might be necessary. He regularly communicated with his student colleagues, and their relationship as a group was mutually supportive and collegial. He was also an important asset to the patient care team as he regularly rounded with them and provided follow-up clinical and resource information. He was professional at all times, with demonstrable responsibility and commitment. He very much accepted and integrated feedback into all of his activities and responsibilities. MD - presented a patient with progressive dementia and severe hypertension. He fully understands the basic medical issues and has very good judgment in assessing problems discussed. He is thorough, thoughtful and well balanced in his conclusions. He is curious and eager to learn. MD - Neville always willing to put in extra effort to do more than what is required. He is a great student that is very helpful in ideas for managing patients. Neville prepares well for presentations and delivers information effectively.  MD - Neville is a hard-working medical student and was very nice to be around. He worked hard on his write-ups and he gave a very good presentation. He was eager to learn and to try and take some of the work off of the team's plate. MD - I had the pleasure of working with Neville for 2 weeks during his Internal Medicine clerkship rotation. He had a positive attitude and was very determined to excel; he was hardworking, a team player and was able to complete multiple tasks in a timely manner. He had excellent presentations during rounds that were very educational and which reflected his knowledge and hard work. Neville was an essential part of the team and I am sure he will continue to shine during all of his rotations.
MD - Neville has shown interest and enthusiasm in taking on patients and being part of the team. He's presented very well on topics assigned during rounds. He always asked good questions. I would recommend that he improve his medical knowledge and continue to read and know more details about his patients.","Longbottom, Neville",Neville,Longbottom,3,11/17/17,2017,7,0.4,G,General,"Barron, Beth"

His case presentation to the group was largely by memory, he kept his fellow students thinking and guessing. His topic presentation on PE was very thorough. 

His write ups were significantly improved in last week of rotation. His formulation and discussion showed good understanding of the pathophysiology of the diseases. His fund of knowledge was at the level expected to his training. He paid great attention to pt's social and personal history, which could affect their medical management significantly. I would recommend Cedric to continue pay attention to time management and submit the write ups earlier during the future rotations in order to obtain feedback sooner.   Practice differential driving history taking, read the topics after each case and reorganized the history and physical to show your better understanding the disease. ","Diggory, Cedric",Diggory,Cedric,2,6/9/17,2017,4,0.2,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"

Cedric has improved over the course of his medicine rotation, particularly with regard to oral presentations and organization of admission presentations. By the end of the rotation, he was able to obtain a very thorough history and organize it well into an HPI which was well-presented from memory. He was very open to feedback and responded well to feedback throughout the rotation. He was able to bring primary literature to rounds when asked to do so. He should continue to expand his fund of knowledge and, as he gets more comfortable on the medicine wards, work on being more proactive to help his patients and team. 





ALLEN ATTENDINGS

Fund of knowledge.   Cedric has a very good fund of knowledge, and was always seeking to improve his knowledge by asking relevant questions and researching clinical questions.
Patient care skills: Cedric has excellent history, and good physical exam skills.  Cedric excels in recognizing the social and environmental determinants that are impacting a patient's health, and drawing the teams' attention to these when they have otherwise been overlooked.  He does a wonderful job of thinking about the patient very as a whole rather than falling into the trap of focusing only on the acute problem.  His skills in synthesizing information are as expected for his level of training.  
Presentations: Cedric responded well to feedback and made dramatic improvements in his presentation skills during his month with us.  His ability to implement the feedback he received was impressive.  He should continue to work on organizing and filtering information to present the findings that are most pertinent to his differential.
Communication Skills: Cedric has excellent communication skills with the patients and team members.  He is always focused on the patient's perspective and ensuring that the patient understood their disease and their plan of care.  When faced with a difficult case where a patient's family was trying to convince the team not to disclose information to the patient, Cedric proposed the perfect phrasing for how to broach this topic with the patient and his family.  
Professionalism: Cedric always demonstrated professional behavior.  He was excellent at integrating feedback, worked well with his co-student to support each other and ensure that they both had opportunities to shine.
Team work: Cedric was an excellent team member, and was always willing to help the team in any way he could to advance patient care.
Teaching: Cedric frequently brought in articles to share with the team on the clinical questions that the team had developed.  His efforts at providing education to the team were much appreciated by all team members.
Overall:  Cedric was a pleasure to work with.  He was eager to learn, integrated feedback well and made marked improvements during his time with us.  We pushed the students on rounds to discuss differentials and clinical reasoning and Cedric did a very good job and made great strides in his clinical reasoning skills.  

Fund of knowledge is as expected for his level of training. He should continue to read on topics of pathophysiology, Diagnoses and management. He should continue to work on developing his own assessment and plans for the day.
Patient care skills: he should continue to work on symptom focused physical exam, Focusing on proper technique. He establishes excellent rapport with his patients and is very in tune to their global Health needs including aspects of mental health and social factors that can be barriers to their care. He is far advanced in this sensitive skill compared to his peers. He gathers an appropriate history related to chief complaints.
Presentations: he has had the most improved presentations I've ever seen with a medical student. He initially started off over wordy and disorganized, but with some simple coaching he was presenting from memory Midway through the rotation. He was able to tell cohesive story and wrap up with an appropriate assessment plan. 
Communication skills: Mr. Diggory is an excellent communicator with patients and families, ancillary staff, and team members. 
Professionalism and attitude (an outstanding student is self-directed, overcomes performance preoccupation to focus on patients and learning, accepts and integrates feedback, is a leader)
Team work: he was and excellent member of the team helping his interns with whatever work needed to be done, Even on patients were not his own
Teaching: He gave several clinically relevant teaching points based on literature searches he performed in an easy to understand manner. He is able to minimize his medical jargon and from the patient, but then use appropriate jargon with the team. ","Diggory, Cedric",Diggory,Cedric,2,6/9/17,2017,4,0.2,G,General,"Ryan, Mike"
